The study measures Cp from 5-50 K and separates magnetic contributions using a polynomial fit for 20-40 K. It computes Cmag and finds a significant discrepancy in Smag values. They later fit a Debye model over the same range but produce contradictory results. This situation warrants a closer look at both calculations and interpretations.",
      "**Evaluating Debye analysis inconsistencies**\n\nThe Debye analysis yields a Smag of 10.86 J/mol-K, but there’s ambiguity in the report. The polynomial method seems to work for many datasets yet produces a low Smag, leading to questions about its reliability. They suggest a Debye fit to explain broad contributions, but without a supporting figure, it's hard to assess. The integration range only includes up to 50 K, which might miss contributions at higher temperatures. Overall, it appears the methods used might not support their conclusions effectively, leading to confusion in analysis.",
      "**Judging the analysis flaws**\n\nI need to decide whether there’s a critical problem in the analysis. In their figures, they use a polynomial fit for lattice contributions but have conflicting results when later employing a Debye fit. The Smag calculated values vary significantly, indicating an inconsistency that raises questions about their conclusions. Their integration method, limited to 50 K, fails to capture essential contributions, which complicates their findings. Overall, I believe this analysis is flawed, and yes, it presents a true problem that deserves attention."

They also discuss the limitation openly in Sec. III.  \n•  Because the paper’s purpose is to compare two wall-reflection models under identical bulk conditions, any moderate inaccuracy in the artificial ν(x) is largely common-mode and does not invalidate the qualitative conclusions.\n\nThus the artificial ν(x) profile is an acknowledged modelling convenience, not a fundamental flaw that undermines the paper’s main results.",

Roughness impacts reflection when energy exceeds certain thresholds, but for boron nitride, most values lie below this threshold, leading to near-unity reflection regardless of C. In magnesium oxide, the effect of changing C from 2 to 1 may only slightly affect reflection. While C is seen as a material property, it could represent interface disorder better.

It seems the original figure was incomplete. Based on this detailed analysis, I think there is indeed a problem.

      "**Evaluating electromagnetic emission in Glasma**\n\nI need to assess whether the assumption of zero electromagnetic emissions from Glasma is valid. The paper argues that Glasma is only gluonic, which suggests no photon or dilepton emissions. However, even a pure gluon plasma can emit electromagnetic radiation through quark loops. This leads to non-zero rates for processes like gg → γγ and gg → gγ. While these rates may be small compared to quark-induced processes, they are not negligible, especially considering quark-antiquark pair production in Glasma after heavy ion collisions.",
      "**Assessing electromagnetic emission assumptions**\n\nThe assumption of zero electromagnetic emission seems extreme and likely flawed. Even if the initial composition is primarily gluons, a finite temperature ensures non-zero quark density, as indicated by nF  T^3. The authors suggest nB/nF approaches infinity as energy over temperature tends to zero, but this leads to a misleading comparison of bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom. Given that emission isn't zero, this assumption is shaky. Therefore, we should recognize that this poses a critical problem for understanding heavy ion puzzles. Let's finalize our response."

However, standard models typically assume fixed measurement bases (like Z or X). If there's a misalignment in the measurement direction, it could lead to measuring a different observable than intended. This situation isn’t addressed by traditional noise models. While fault-tolerant analysis focuses on gate errors rather than measurement errors, misalignment can be treated as a coherent error before measuring. If this noise stays below a certain threshold, concatenation can help improve overall reliability.",

In established fault-tolerant theory, however, any such mis-alignment (together with all other imperfections in the measurement circuit) is simply another contribution to the overall noise channel acting on data and ancilla qubits. After the full circuit—including imperfect CNOTs and measurements—this noise channel can always be expanded in the Pauli basis; the resulting (generally coherent) errors are then mapped to Pauli errors on data qubits plus classical read-out errors, all of which are handled by standard threshold theorems. Modern proofs explicitly cover arbitrary local CPTP noise, not only stochastic “flip” models, and do not rely on knowing the microscopic direction of each error.\n\nConsequently, the assertion that “we cannot correct for our error because the information is continuous” conflicts with existing, rigorously proved results and with extensive numerical threshold studies that include coherent over-rotations and measurement-axis drifts.

While the edge structure E is static, this is common in knowledge-graph–guided GNNs; adaptability is achieved through the learnable node embeddings and their sample-dependent fusion with visual features. Empirically, the paper’s ablations (e.g., Fig. 10, Table 5) show that the model does benefit from sample-specific reasoning despite the fixed E.\n\nHence the cited “critical problem” does not invalidate the method.",

In Section 3.4, they describe using the evolved global semantic graph representation, which relates to visual features. I’m curious if GCN weights are trainable based on image-specific features. While GCN typically uses a static E, the mapping matrix is calculated from features on a per-sample basis, suggesting some dynamic adaptation exists, even if E remains static. However, can adaptation still occur despite the static edges?",

However, the authors suggest that dynamic learning of semantics may still be somewhat limited within the segmentation network. In this network, they use a global graph that stays the same across images, but dynamic mapping happens since the output varies per pixel and sample. Overall, it seems like anyone saying there’s a problem might be mistaken. Let's work on finalizing this assessment."

No alternative, non-series construction (e.g. a convergent limit, an operator equation solved without series, or a lattice/functional analytic definition) is supplied, nor is any proof of convergence or resummation of the infinite graph sum.\n\nTherefore the final object remains a formal perturbative series; merely renormalizing each coefficient does not make the construction non-perturbative.

In summarizing the paper, it appears Stoyanovsky introduces the Weyl–Moyal algebra and constructs an evolution operator through a time-ordered exponential of the Hamiltonian. He addresses both regular and non-regular Hamiltonians, emphasizing a method distinct from typical perturbative renormalization, which is a critical aspect to evaluate thoroughly.",

If the sum ultimately defines the operator after renormalization, it claims to be independent of coupling expansion—even if the series remains formal. The distinction between perturbative and non-perturbative is subtle. Just because the method uses an infinite series doesn't automatically make it perturbative, particularly if the series converges. However, without demonstrating convergence, it risks being seen as purely formal. It’s an intriguing area to explore!",

However, in the actual derivation, β is determined by the initial equilibrium distribution and bath temperature, meaning the system doesn't have to be at a defined temperature during non-equilibrium processes.

Many emphasize the equality's validity away from equilibrium, showing Muschik misinterprets this point. So, yes, there truly is a problem with Muschik’s conclusions. It's important to summarize that Muschik’s critique arises from this misinterpretation, confirming it as a valid issue."

I wonder if using effective temperature is widely accepted; it can be useful phenomenologically. However, claiming a quantum advantage without solid justification might mislead.

Purpose of the switch The authors explicitly say they want an effective potential that is reliable at “relatively weak coupling near-infrared” scales, i.e. near the phase-transition region. The Coleman–Weinberg one-loop form in Eq. (10) is appropriate only for the deep-infrared (αs≈1). Replacing it by the quartic Landau-Ginzburg form in Eq. (11) is a standard phenomenological step when one studies critical behaviour close to Tc.\n\n2. Preservation of symmetry breaking pattern Both Eq. (10) and Eq. (11) have the same minima structure (〈φ〉=φ0) and therefore generate the same magnetic condensation and dual superconducting vacuum that the rest of the paper builds on.\n\n3. Parameter matching The authors state that with λ→1 the zero-temperature quantities (string tension, glueball masses, etc.) “exactly reproduce those obtained using the one-loop potential”; i.e. the two potentials are calibrated to give identical input for later bag-model and Tc estimates. Hence the numerical results do not hinge on an arbitrary potential choice.\n\n4.

While using phenomenological potentials is common, they must show that the results match qualitatively. Their choice of λ seems arbitrary, leading me to wonder if this introduces inconsistencies in their results.",

The authors use the RG-improved tree-level potential  \n V(h) ≃ λh(h) h⁴/4 with μ = h.  \n This is the standard leading-log treatment employed in essentially all modern SM vacuum-stability studies.  It is reliable for deciding whether a deeper minimum appears at h ≫ v, because at such field values the quartic term dominates and the RG-running of λh encapsulates the leading quantum effects.\n\n2. Claim actually made.  When they say the electroweak vacuum becomes “completely stable” or “the only minimum”, they mean no lower minimum exists along the h direction once λh(h) stays positive up to the cut-off; the quadratic term already guarantees the minimum at v, so a second one can arise only if λh becomes negative.  Within that context the statement is justified.\n\n3. Other field directions.  Extra minima involving the heavy PQ scalar would require negative quartic combinations.  In the region they study λφ > 0 and λhφ > 0, so the quartic form  \n λh h⁴ + λφ φ⁴ + λhφ h²φ²  \nis positive definite; hence no additional deep minimum appears once h and φ are both large.  Threshold effects are handled (φ and the heavy quarks decouple below their masses) and do not change that conclusion.\n\n4. Higher-loop/gauge issues.  Two-loop RG and one-loop matching are already used; known three-loop corrections shift the stability boundary only slightly and do not alter the qualitative result.  Gauge dependence of the effective potential also affects only percent-level details.\n\nTherefore the paper’s use of Eq.

However, to address potential local minima caused by new scalar fields, one should include threshold corrections. Their conclusion assumes complete stability based on positivity up to the Planck scale.",

The approximation focusing only on the quartic term might miss important details about quadratic contributions.

Their reliance on the positivity of coupling constants is a standard approach in vacuum stability analysis, making the concern seem like an unfounded alarm. Overall, I think \"No, it’s a false alarm.\"",
      "**Creating a concise explanation**\n\nI want to clearly outline that the stability claim focuses solely on the direction related to h; other directions with Φ decouple because of a large mass and positive portal. Positive quartic couplings ensure that the potential remains bounded and that there aren’t additional minima. The use of leading-log RG-improved tree-level potential is standard and sufficient for determining the sign of quartics and identifying large-field minima. Since both quartic and portal couplings are positive, the only minima present are electroweak and PQ, with the electroweak being the deepest. This indicates it's not a critical issue."

Their disk approach effectively captures this interaction, providing quantitative results that still reflect trends despite recognized limitations. So, the simplification doesn't invalidate their findings."

When looking at a 2D interface, the interaction of in-plane currents creates a B_z component. In a static scenario, electric fields are related to the gradient of the scalar potential, but if we consider the vector potential, it might modify boundary conditions. I'm questioning if dynamic magnetic fields play a significant role in 2D plasmons' behaviors as they might affect dispersion characteristics.",

For graphene, the plasmon frequency (ω) is proportional to the square root of q, resulting in q c being significantly larger than ω, which means magnetic effects and dynamic magnetic fields can be ignored. The paper mentions conductivity with magnetic fields and simplifies vector potentials. When analyzing numbers, with q set around 1e7 m^-1, I find that ignoring vector potential contributions is permissible. Thus, the warning about it is a false alarm."

Yet, in categories, I question whether the product of infinitely many small categories might serve as a retract. Testing property (vii) reveals that products do not preserve colimits for infinite indices. While the functor LFun(C, -) should preserve colimits, this seems contradicted by the nature of products, leading me to conclude that the claim about dualizability must be false.",

For example, if C = ∏_{i∈I} Sp with I infinite, localization might not work as expected. Since products don't preserve colimits, I find the claim true. I conclude that the problem is valid, and the product of dualizable categories isn't necessarily dualizable."

      "**Analyzing resource costs**\n\nI need to analyze the paper excerpt regarding the colleague's concern about the resource cost of dissipative encoding not being discussed. In Section II.B, the paper covers dissipative quantum walks and their non-unitary nature, which inherently lowers the probability of success. While they mention normalization and adjustments to coefficients due to dissipation, they don't specifically address the success probability or resource overhead. Instead, they focus on how the projection steps incorporate the D polarization, resetting the coin at each step with a polarizer.",
      "**Investigating deterministic transformations**\n\nI’m questioning whether the polarizer leads to deterministic transformations. An ideal polarizer transmits only the D component, but if the initial polarization is unknown, only a fraction gets through. If they use a half-wave plate to rotate the polarization first, could it then be deterministic? They want to avoid interference between H and V components. After the coin operator, the state becomes a mix, which might lose amplitude when filtering for D each step. Their scheme uses a D-polarizer effectively projecting onto D. However, they mention that the projection operator reduces total probability, making the quantum walks nonunitary—yet they don't analyze the resource cost or the success probability adequately.",

I believe this omission does reflect a true problem, as it hinders the assessment of scalability, but it’s more of a limitation rather than a fundamental error. Let's address this clearly in our final answer."

Values this small have little influence on the Kozai–Lidov cycle amplitudes, so omitting the octupole term in the population synthesis is a standard and well-justified simplification. Section 4 of the paper explicitly shows that only extreme, very rare eccentricities (eout ≳ 0.9) would make εoct large enough to change the qualitative results.\n\n2. Stellar oblateness – Precession from the stellar quadrupole matters only for rapidly rotating stars (Pspin ≲ 3 d) and/or very massive close-in planets. Most stars in the sample are older solar-type stars with rotation periods ≳10 d, and most of the observed perpendicular planets are sub-Jovian to a few-Jovian masses.

The authors suggest a threshold for changes but note that typical outer planet eccentricities are below their critical limits, implying neglect of the term may be reasonable. Similarly, the stellar oblateness isn't likely to have a drastic impact. Thus, the critique may not suggest a critical problem—this seems more minor than fatal. So, I'm concluding it’s a false alarm."

They do this as a way to simplify induction, but it raises questions about consistency with original parameters p and q. The definitions are somewhat confusing, but they clarify that (0, -p, q) is shorthand rather than an actual dividing set. I need to ensure that the recursive formulations and notations are consistently applied.",

So, N(1, p, q) connects to N(1, p', q') by multiplying N(0, p, q). When testing with specific values like p=2 and q=1, I find consistent results that verify the formula. A colleague raised concerns about N(0, p, q) using the same p and q but resulting in different dividing sets. However, the authors clarify that this is merely a notational shortcut, and the recurrence remains valid. Thus, it seems to be a misunderstanding rather than a real issue."

This seems to imply that the initialization with modulo functions correctly, countering concerns about the algorithm’s integrity. I conclude there may have been misunderstandings about how the remainder is supposed to behave."

Definition 1 states that a D-number is a mapping on the power set 2^Θ, where Θ = {F1,…,FN} is merely a set of distinct “labels’’ (its elements are not required to be mutually exclusive, but they are still just elements of Θ, not subsets of some underlying domain).  \n2. In Definition 3 the combination rule sums over B1,B2 ⊆ Θ and uses their set–theoretic intersection B1 ∩ B2. For singleton subsets this intersection is always ∅ because {Fi} ∩ {Fj}=∅ whenever i≠j.  \n3. Example 1 instead interprets the labels ‘High’ and ‘Medium’ themselves as overlapping sets (e.g., fuzzy subsets of an evaluation scale) and, after combination, assigns full mass to High ∩ Medium. This requires taking the intersection of the *contents* of the labels, not of the singleton subsets {High} and {Medium}. Under the formal definitions, the rule would actually put the whole mass on ∅, not on High ∩ Medium.  \n4. Consequently the illustrative calculation in Example 1 is incompatible with the formal machinery just defined; the paper silently switches from “labels-as-atoms’’ to “labels-as-sets’’ without redefining Θ or the combination rule.  \n\nHence the inconsistency is real and does weaken the theoretical foundation.",

They've removed mutual exclusiveness and completeness, suggesting overlap in meanings for elements of Θ, like “High” and “Medium.” I’m realizing that if I take labels as subsets, it leads to empty intersections, which raises questions about how D assigns mass in those cases.",

This conflicts with the earlier definitions where labels are distinct elements. I wonder if they now allow overlapping among elements in Θ and if High and Medium can actually be fuzzy sets. They define Θ as distinct sets, meaning they may allow for non-empty intersections now. But if I take the subsets {High} and {Medium}, their intersection is still empty, creating confusion.",

In this sense, high-level interactions don’t quite align, suggesting inconsistency in the definitions. If they're treating Fi as sets, then Θ might indeed be a set of sets, meaning intersections exist. This leads me to conclude that there's a real issue here, and I should articulate that clearly."

However, as time progresses, the core boundary crosses sub-box boundaries. In the relevant paper, they only utilize the central half of the box for spectra. Since the core boundaries exceed the artifact's influence, the criticism about speed is likely incorrect. Overall, it seems to be a false alarm regarding this artifact's impact."

In Proposition 9 the author chooses  \n        m − n/p  <  λ  <  (m − n/p)/k   ( with k > 1 ).  \n    Because m < n/p, the quantity m − n/p is negative.  \n    Dividing this negative number by k (>1) makes it *less negative*, hence  \n\n            m − n/p  <  λ  <  (m − n/p)/k  \n\n    is a non-empty interval, so such λ can indeed be picked.\n\n3.

Wait, there's a slight issue with the text: it says to choose λ so that m - n/p < λ < (1/k)(m - n/p). Since m - n/p is negative, the right side appears greater than the left.

Since k is greater than 1, dividing results in a value between 0 and -0.5. Hence, λ can indeed be chosen within (-0.5, -0.25). However, for the function g, it needs to be negative, and based on Lemma 1, g is in W^m_p if λ > m-n/p. This condition is satisfied.

This means the application of Lemma 1 is consistent, clearing up any misunderstanding. I think I should prepare a clear explanation for better understanding."

      "**Assessing distortion impact**\n\nWhile the resizing may distort shapes, it guarantees a consistent 10x10 block grid for feature computation. The algorithm relies on features relative to this normalized grid, so the distortion likely won't affect classification since both training and testing data undergo the same scaling. Even though there’s a claim that shape distortion is critical for recognition, high accuracy results imply it's not inherently problematic. Given their justification from experiments with the 60x30 size, this distortion seems manageable and not critical after all."

There’s a claim that in the last step of teleportation, Bob must transform either the qubit or the micro-detector to recover Alice's state. I have some doubts about this idea. It seems to overlook that corrections should apply to the entire system, not just one part. If Bob knows the measurement result, he should perform a unitary operation on the whole composite Hilbert space.

Under these well-defined conditions the transverse phonon network constitutes the entire transport channel, and analysing it alone is sufficient for the claims they make (scaling of κ, sensitivity to disorder, etc.).

Every bidder, while the game is still “alive”, keeps raising her bid whenever doing so is still profitable (Lines 8–9 of Algorithm 2). Hence, whenever her true valuation v i still exceeds the current critical value c i, she will eventually raise her bid to (at least) c i+ε and declare herself a winner; if v i ≤ c i she must eventually give up.  \n   • This guarantees that, in the limit, each winner in the centralized greedy run (which is executed with bids b i = v i) either also wins in the decentralized run or else would have to pay more than her own valuation and therefore would rationally withdraw.  \n\n2. Because bids never fall and the resource-capacity check in Algorithm 3 is carried out in *global* BRF order (all higher-ranked, still-winning bids are aggregated), once an agent has finally declared x i = 1 that declaration can no longer be overturned by later moves of lower-ranked bidders. This lets the induction in the proof of Theorem 4 go through exactly as written.\n\nTrying to build a counter-example quickly shows that whenever a centralized winner is pushed out by some rival’s higher bid, the centralized winner can still raise (provided v i > c i) and eventually re-enter, and the escalation stops precisely when the set of winners coincides with that of the centralized greedy algorithm or when a bidder’s valuation ceiling is hit (in which case the centralized algorithm would not have selected that bidder in the first place). No violation of capacity can occur because every step preserves the condition proven in Theorem 2.\n\nHence the consistency claim—the decentralized procedure ends with exactly the same winner set as the centralized greedy pass using the same BRF—is in fact valid, and the objection you were told about stems from overlooking the “keep raising while profitable” rule that drives the process to the centralized outcome.",

This follows from standard arguments already used by Connes and Skandalis in the boundary-free case and from the functoriality of the Debord–Skandalis Blup construction.  \n•  The intermediate identification “bN ≅ Blup_{r,s}( bN, N_V )” is legitimate because both arguments are again taken as unit groupoids; the Blup of an inclusion of unit groupoids is itself a unit groupoid (a manifold), so there is no confusion between Lie algebroids and groupoids.  \n•  Hence the Morita equivalence claimed in Lemma 4.1 is valid, and the definition of the topological index bInd_t and the proof of Theorem 4.4 are not affected.\n\nTherefore the alleged “critical problem” is unfounded.",

If their reimplementation isn’t optimized, it might affect speed, but using the same library maintains fairness.

Proposition 3.4 is the perverse-sheaf analogue established in Jiang’s earlier work [21] (and independently in Calabrese [16]).  The proof again takes place inside the same stack-valued Hall algebra: it only uses\n   – the definition of the convolution product through short exact sequences, and  \n   – basic properties of the torsion pair (T,F).  \n   These arguments are purely set–theoretic on stacks and remain valid verbatim for the motivic Hall algebra H(A).\n\n3. The later “motivic” refinement in the present paper arises when the integration map I is applied to pass from H(A) to the motivic quantum torus; the Hall-algebra identities themselves are established before this step and hence do not require any new compatibility checks with motivic vanishing-cycle data.\n\nHence the criticism that “the correctness of the Hall algebra identities in the motivic setting is not fully established” is unfounded.",

However, is this a critical issue? First, OHSUMED focuses on clinical journals, and concepts there may not reflect broader MEDLINE content. Common terms in OHSUMED may appear rare elsewhere, leading to potential bias in query ranking. Also, with IDF calculated from just 350,000 documents versus 22 million, frequency counts could be inaccurate. This could degrade performance, and using the same dataset for evaluation may inflate results. So, yes, it's a true problem."

The initial correlation between Alice and Bob is provided through an EPR beams covariance matrix, hinting that D and Δ might depend on α after all. \n\nHowever, in reverse reconciliation protocols, Eve's knowledge about Bob's data actually relies on channel parameters, independent of Alice-Bob correlation. The purification property suggests a certain independence in Eve's modes, which is intriguing to unpack!",
      "**Exploring correlation independence**\n\nAfter Bob measures his mode, the resulting state might only depend on his measurements and Eve's knowledge, possibly leading to a conclusion about the independence of Eve's accessible information from the Alice-Bob correlation in the reverse reconciliation (RR) scheme. \n\nHowever, I need to consider how the variance and correlation parameters interact. It seems that while the formulas suggest independence, concerns about dependence still linger. But upon further examination, it appears that the variance reflects local conditions rather than correlation, which supports the paper's claims. Therefore, I think we can confidently state that the colleague's concern is likely a misunderstanding."

I notice the need for another edge to maintain specific degree counts in V. So, if v is part of an edge with endpoints in V and outside, it affects the overall structure.",

Because v would then be a pivot lying in sc(B′), the inner while-loop of that call would have detected it and recursed once more, contradicting termination.\n\n• This argument silently assumes that the pivot of the newly badly coloured set B* lies inside the scope sc(B′) that was just recoloured. That need not be true: sc(B′) may recolour only a proper subset of B*, turning B* badly coloured while its pivot lies outside sc(B′). In that case the inner while-loop does not see the new pivot and the call legitimately terminates, so Lemma 3 fails.\n\n• Consequently new pivots can appear among vertices that were previously non-pivots; hence the main loop can be triggered more than l times.

Section 3.5 explicitly recognises this and extends the construction by assigning to every surface in the vertex region the *same* linear space that one gets from the neighbouring Feynman region (eqs. (111)–(113)). Thus every point of the full moduli space is equipped with a linear space, so the coverage gap is patched by definition.  \n3. The S-transformation in the paper is defined algebraically—as a map between those linear spaces—rather than as an explicit diffeomorphism on the geometric moduli. Since the spaces on the vertex region are by construction isomorphic to those on the Feynman region, the algebraic map extends consistently to the whole moduli space.  \n4. Because of this isomorphism the usual consistency conditions (dimension matching, partition-function invariance, etc.) can still be imposed globally. The construction therefore does not depend on having an explicit sewing parameterisation everywhere, only on having an assignment of linear spaces everywhere—which the authors provide.\n\nTherefore the limited coverage of the sewing parameterisation does not invalidate, or even restrict, the definition of the S-transformation they propose.",

(3.9)–(3.11).  \n•  All stochastic quadratic-variation terms disappear for large |u| because of σ=η=0 there.  \n•  The telescoping identity for the Φ–term makes its spatial sum vanish, so no uncontrolled remainder is left.  \n\nThus the inequality produced in (3.11) indeed forces β(u_Δx)=0, i.e. |u_Δx|≤M_f, without needing any additional regularity.

The present paper merely combines the two techniques: the BV–type bounds from [7] with the Lévy stochastic calculus from [13]. No new delicate interaction term between Φ and the jumps is overlooked.\n\n• All places where the degeneracy could matter (appearance of ∂xΦ) are handled separately (see Lemmas 4.5–4.7). In the stochastic lemmas the authors only need boundedness of σ, η and β'' together with standard Itô–Lévy identities, which they justify.\n\n• Hence the adaptations are routine and the arguments given (use of mollifiers, Itô formula, Fubini/BDG bounds) are sufficient. There is no missing term or hidden regularity assumption.\n\nTherefore the alleged “critical problem’’ is unfounded.",

All bounds are eventually reduced to the new Lemma 3.5, which gives an \\(\\varepsilon^{-1}\\!\\)-type control of the discrete gradients. That lemma is proved explicitly in Section 3 and is the only place where discreteness really matters.  \n• The adaptations that are borrowed from the cited papers concern purely analytic inequalities (e.g. symmetry of \\(\\beta_{\\xi}\\), estimates like \\(|f_\\beta(a,b)-f(a,b)|\\le C\\xi(1+|a|+|b|)\\)), which hold verbatim for the discrete setting; no step requires additional stochastic–difference arguments that are missing.  \n• Consequently, Lemmas 4.4 and 4.7 (and the terms \\(I_4, J_4\\)) are justified: every appearance of a discrete quantity is accompanied either by an explicit calculation or by an appeal to Lemma 3.5/3.3, not by an unadapted citation.\n\nHence the alleged “critical problem” is only a request for more intermediate algebraic details, not a flaw that undermines the estimates.",
