In local coordinates, when testing with y = tx, U becomes x(1 + t), which is a monomial times a unit. This suggests that blowup leads to monomialization of U.

I'm examining mx0's characteristics—it's not principal when n>1, so its pullback may not be principal either.

For instance, if A = (x+y) and B = (x), their product fails to be monomial. This leads me to think that perhaps if the product is a principal monomial, both factors need to be monomial themselves.

For instance, I might blow up along a subvariety that still yields a monomial product but doesn't make U monomial.

First, I’ll look at the equations. Equation (1) presents Z[p,k] as a measurement, and equations (3) and (4) use `l_{k,p}(z,µ)` depending on a summation involving k. Now, in equation (5), the vector f_Hk is defined with the exponent related to (k-1). I’m noticing a shift they might have made in the indexing for k, which could lead to a mismatch.",

For example, in equation (1), k ranges from 0 to N-1, but then they shift to k-1, which seems to create a mismatch with the exponents.

By tuning Vo and Vc the authors flatten the I(V) curve and obtain full-range phase, thereby suppressing that DC component.  \n• Pixel pitch and gap diffraction are, of course, unchanged, but the dominant unwanted zeroth-order term in a practical SLM setup is usually the RAM/DC leakage, not the purely structural grating order. The simulations and experiments (δ ↑, η ↓ by ~90 %) match this interpretation.  \n• Thus the causal link is present; the paper might over-use the term “pixelation effect”, but its central claim—that proper Vo/Vc calibration suppresses the measurable zeroth-order beam—is substantiated.\n\nTherefore the issue raised by your colleague does not invalidate the paper’s main conclusion.",

      "**Analyzing pixelation and voltage**\n\nI need to evaluate a paper that claims adjusting voltage parameters can eliminate zeroth-order light due to pixelation effects. The paper may not clearly explain how voltage tuning connects to suppressing the zeroth-order related to the pixelation. The pixelation effect happens because of a periodic structure that creates diffraction orders. While global voltage settings adjust phase linearity and amplitude response, they don’t change the pixel structure itself. However, they can influence residual amplitude modulation and phase errors, potentially leaking energy into the zeroth order if modulation depth is insufficient.",
      "**Examining phase fidelity and zeroth order**\n\nI’m looking into how improving phase fidelity directs more power to the intended order, which in turn reduces zeroth order leakage. The authors attribute zeroth order presence to pixelation effect but seem to suggest it’s tied to voltage calibration. Is that a misunderstanding? They mention changes in voltage impacting reflection intensity, yet they don't fully clarify how Vc and Vo address pixelation independently. Essentially, while improving modulation efficiency helps reduce leakage, the pixelation effect itself remains constant. The term “pixelation” might even be misapplied here. Their claim of a 91% elimination could stem from better amplitude uniformity rather than purely addressing pixelation.",
      "**Clarifying pixelation and voltage tuning**\n\nThe authors generally discuss pixelation, linking its elimination to improved phase linearity and reduced amplitude modulation. They provide equations relating voltage settings to phase retardation and reflection intensity, outlining a causal relationship, though it may not be clearly emphasized. Voltage tuning doesn’t alter the physical pixel structure, but it adjusts the modulation effects of each pixel. By optimizing voltage settings, it’s possible to minimize the zeroth order light contribution. While the term \"pixelation effect\" could be clearer, it’s not a critical issue. Thus, the concern seems overblown."

There's an expectation about an additional l factor possibly being l^{-1/2}. From Hong's earlier work, the lemma states similar bounds, but I realize that if both sides share the same argument, the inequality could indeed be trivial. To hold true, the factor must be less than or equal to a constant, and I think the estimation actually needs to consider a positive power of l to ensure angular regularity.",

The text appeals qualitatively to accelerated expansion and the possibility of choosing a small patch, but it gives no concrete dynamical or statistical mechanism—classical, quantum, thermodynamic, or otherwise—that can guarantee complete removal of every baryon, dark-matter particle and black hole from the causally connected region that subsequently contracts.

After the bounce and during expansion, Ω_k changes when the matter dominance kicks in, but they're suggesting that the scale factor's reduction affects the absolute value of Ω_k.

By testing the formulas, as R_C scales down, the curvature parameter effectively becomes smaller due to increasing critical density. Ultimately, reducing the scale factor leads to a decrease in Ω_k, confirming consistency in their claims. So, it's a false alarm! Now, I can craft a final answer explaining this clearly."

The GH entropy concept is complex, as there may be no event horizon during contraction when radiation dominates. But at turnaround, the horizon size is about 13.8 billion light-years. The relevant retained region is smaller than that horizon. Consequently, since GH entropy isn’t applicable in the contracted state, the issues raised aren’t critical.

The paper inaccurately claims AMY employs classical limits for dilepton emission rates, suggesting simplifications that may misrepresent their approach. It's crucial to recognize that widely used hydrodynamic codes might couple AMY rates with quantum-statistical factors, so the critique's concerns about overestimating high-temperature emissions are valid. Let's ensure the final explanation is clear and concise."

Hence a “second round” (and third, fourth, …) is intrinsic to the imperfect-measurement model itself.\n\n• If one could measure all stabilizers simultaneously with one perfect collective apparatus, there would indeed be only one round of rotations and the scaling would revert to quadratic—but such a measurement is physically impossible in the standard circuit model, as the authors note (Supplement, bullet 3). Therefore the linear scaling they report is tied to the measurement-direction inaccuracy, not to a separately injected idle error source.\n\n• The simulations described in the main text already include exactly these per-measurement rotations and no unspecified additional noise; the Supplement merely spells out the same mechanism in the smallest code.\n\nThus the critic’s claim that the paper “critically depends on unspecified idle-qubit errors” misreads the role of the unavoidable per-measurement rotations, and does not undermine the paper’s core argument.",

However, when measuring stabilizers sequentially, idle intervals introduce noise from CNOTs, which complicates things. The main text doesn’t emphasize these second rotations, and the problem may lie in fairness of simulation, as they've added errors without proper mention.",

The critic claims idle qubit errors are essential, but the bullet clarifies that the second round arises from measurement errors. \n\nLooking at bullet #3, it mentions that measuring two stabilizers simultaneously doesn’t prevent rotation errors, as these arise from inherent measurement inaccuracies. So, the authors argue that the second round is inherent and unavoidable. Therefore, it seems critics may be misinterpreting the issue; it's not about idle errors but rather about measurement direction errors. My conclusion will highlight that this is a false alarm since the second round is a natural consequence of repeated imperfect measurements."

Those theorems require only that the error amplitude at each location be below a constant threshold in the appropriate norm; they do not require the experimenter to know the specific error instance mε.  \n• Because the small rotation acts on a single qubit and is independent for each gate use, it remains correctable: after syndrome extraction it is mapped to an effective Pauli error whose rate is O(ε²), not O(ε).  This has been verified analytically and in many numerical threshold studies of coherent noise.  \n• The paper’s claim that “the stabilizers ĝi are not perfectly known, therefore the error is fundamentally uncorrectable” overlooks the fact that FT protocols handle unknown errors by design; “unknown” is not the same as “uncorrectable.”  \n• Therefore the linear-in-ε logical error scaling reported in the paper comes from using a non-fault-tolerant measurement circuit and from stopping the analysis after a single round.

They proved this by removing uncolored vertices and examining components. For circle graphs, the argument claims a similar reduction without proper justification; I’m questioning its validity. Is it true that we can find noncrossing scanlines from an optimal black-and-white coloring in circle graphs? I'll explore how permutation graphs relate to intervals and how the scanlines function in this context.",
      "**Considering scanlines and colors**\n\nThis brings me to the idea of pairwise non-intersecting scanlines. For circle graphs, we have chords inside a circle, and I wonder if we can define scanlines as additional chords that avoid endpoints. Removing uncolored chords could create “sectors” in the circle, but I need to check if that's valid. If I think about a circle where chords alternate colors radially, could uncolored chords avoid crossing partition lines? \n\nI see that black and white chords shouldn't intersect, but colors can intersect within their own sets. So, I need to partition chords into black, white, and uncolored to ensure no crossings between black and white. Can we always find scanlines to separate them properly? In permutation graphs, I can order chords left-to-right for clearer regions.",

Noncrossing chords must have their endpoints appear in a specific order, without overlapping arcs along the circle. If we partition the circle into arcs for black and white chords, there shouldn’t be an alternation pattern (B-W-B) indicating that chords from different colors can't nest. \n\nFor instance, if a black chord's endpoints are at 0° and 300°, and a white chord's endpoints are at 10° and 290°, that configuration causes crossing. Thus, black and white chords must occupy separate regions of the circle. I’ll need to ensure each color’s endpoints are consistently grouped, potentially using multiple noncrossing scanlines to maintain separation across different arcs.",

I realize that even after removing it, we can still insert a scanline separating the remaining colored chords, which holds up.\n\nNext, I consider arrangements of chords where they don't alternate or nest, confirming that sets must be arranged in arcs to separate effectively. It seems the previous concerns were premature; the reduction likely holds true, as we can indeed create scanlines between components. I’ll summarize this reasoning concisely."

Lattice data and many effective approaches show that B(T) must drop and essentially disappear near the deconfinement/ crossover temperature.\n\n•  In the paper B is fixed once and for all from T = 0 glue-ball masses (Eq. 43) or kept as an external constant.  This constant value is then inserted unchanged into all finite-T formulae in Sects. 5–6.\n\n•  Because ε–3P = 4B in their model, a non-vanishing, fixed B automatically enforces a latent heat Δε = 4B and therefore a first-order transition.  If B(T) were allowed to fall with T (and go to zero at T≈Tc as expected), the latent heat would shrink and the order and location of the transition would change, in qualitative agreement with lattice results (crossover for two light flavours).\n\n•  Hence using a T-independent B is not just a harmless simplification; it can shift Tc by O(30–50 MeV) and misidentify the order of the transition.  The conclusions drawn for energy density, specific heat, speed of sound, etc., inherit this built-in bias.\n\nConsequently the critique that treating B as temperature-independent is a serious flaw in the finite-temperature analysis is justified.",

For 2+1 flavor QCD, it’s a crossover, so using a constant B misrepresents the transition. Therefore, I see this as a valid criticism: the bag constant is likely T-dependent, and not addressing it counts as an omission."

From Jost-Zuo's work, they showed a unique harmonic metric exists for reductive representations with unipotent local monodromy without requiring a specific real or complex condition. Does this imply that the harmonic bundle can automatically have a real structure?",
      "**Exploring real structure in harmonic bundles**\n\nReal structure isn't automatic; it requires the flat bundle to be part of a real local system. Simpson's theory shows that the harmonic bundle from a complex representation leads to a Higgs bundle that can have real structure when the representation is polarizable. However, a general reductive representation in complex might not guarantee this. The authors imply a real structure exists, but don't justify it. Is it because the representation is reductive? They need to explore if such an antilinear isomorphism can be defined for a harmonic bundle based on the connection's flatness."

For example, Plane Couette requires a minimal box of 250 x 100, while pipes approach minimal swirling at 9.4D. The concern about truncated domains and laminarization is valid; it's not just a false alarm. So, yes, this is a genuine limitation that needs to be addressed."

Since m_φ(µ) ≃ √(2 λ_φ(µ)) f_a, increasing f_a pushes m_φ up and therefore tends to raise µ_c.\n\n2.  The running of λ_φ(µ) is driven at one‐loop mainly by the positive term 2 λ_hφ² (see eq. (4) of the paper).  A larger portal coupling λ_hφ accelerates the growth of λ_φ and hence raises m_φ(µ), further increasing µ_c.\n\n3.  Therefore, if f_a is increased but we still want µ_c < µ_0, we must compensate by choosing a *smaller* λ_hφ(mt) so that λ_φ (and hence m_φ) grows more slowly and µ_c stays below µ_0.  This is exactly what the authors say.\n\n4.  The price of lowering λ_hφ is that the stabilising effect on the Higgs quartic becomes weaker; beyond some f_a no value of λ_hφ can simultaneously keep µ_c below µ_0 *and* stabilise the Higgs potential.  That logic is what produces the upper bound on f_a.\n\nThus the direction of the inequality claimed in the paper is correct and the step is justified; the apparent contradiction arises only if one neglects the λ_hφ-dependence of m_φ(µ).",

Hence some edge f among those 2k*–2 must lie in the intersection C₀ ∩ C*; otherwise no edge of C₀ would have been recolored and C₀ could not switch from “good’’ to “bad’’.\n\n• Edge f is exactly one of the edges that RECOLOR(e*, C*) keeps monitoring in its inner while-loop (line 4). Therefore, once C₀ becomes “bad’’, that loop is obliged to notice f (the least such edge) and launch another recursive RECOLOR call; thus RECOLOR(e*, C*) cannot terminate while C₀ remains bad.\n\n• Consequently, when RECOLOR(e, C) finally returns, no edge that was “good’’ at its entry—nor the triggering edge e—can still participate in a “bad’’ cycle, exactly as Lemma 2 claims. The progression argument used later in Lemma 3 therefore remains valid.\n\nSo the alleged gap hinges on the impossible situation where a cycle turns bad without any of its recolored edges lying in the monitored set.

      "**Evaluating integral arguments**\n\nThe paper claims that the second term vanishes due to antisymmetry in the integrand when integrating over particle coordinates. However, the product of two odd functions results in an even function for each variable, potentially complicating the argument. I need to assess the parity of the integrand. The overlap integral approximation being around c^4 raises questions, especially considering the expected small overlap between orthogonal wavefunctions in adjacent cells. While P states might contribute, should we neglect D contributions? It's worth diving a bit deeper into these aspects.",
      "**Assessing overlapping contributions**\n\nThe paper's claim regarding the antisymmetry of integrals might be misleading. I need to evaluate the size of neglected contributions, especially by comparing coefficients. The terms with larger coefficients seem valid, as coefficients for c and b differ significantly. I see that the proposed antisymmetry argument holds, since integrating odd functions results in zero. Therefore, while contributions may appear large, their effects are indeed small. I conclude that the criticism about overshadowing is incorrect, and the approximation in the paper stands.",
      "**Explaining integrand contributions**\n\nThe cross terms in the overlap integrand vanish due to parity because the products of odd functions integrated separately yield zero. Even though the product is even overall, terms involving one or two d-orbitals are significantly suppressed by a small coefficient and a negligible spatial overlap, making their contributions much smaller than the leading term. Including these terms wouldn't affect the derived J_d within the uncertainties, which makes the approximation reliable. Now, I’ll craft the final answer."

The non-unitary (dissipative) walk indeed multiplies the V-component of the input by a known, state-independent factor γ=√(Z_{N+1}/Z_N).  \n2. This amounts to the fixed linear map S = diag(1,γ) acting on the physical qubit before the isometry that sends |H⟩→|φ_N⟩ and |V⟩→|φ_{N+1}⟩.  \n3. Because γ depends only on the chosen walk length N, it can be calibrated once; compensating it is nothing more than preparing the physical qubit with a slightly different polarization ratio (a deterministic, loss-free operation with linear optics).  \n4. Therefore any logical state A|0⟩_L + B|1⟩_L can still be encoded deterministically by choosing the input polarization (α,β) = (A, B/γ), or, equivalently, by inserting a simple gain/attenuation stage before the encoder.  \n5. The need for this known pre-factor does not violate linearity, does not introduce fundamental noise, and does not prevent “arbitrary logical states” from being encoded; it just fixes a calibration constant.\n\nThus the “distortion” is a trivial, correctable scaling, not a critical flaw in the scheme.",

In the dissipative-QW variant the “projection” onto the diagonal polarization |D〉 is implemented with an ordinary polarizer acting on a continuous-variable (squeezed-vacuum) field, not on single photons.  \n2. The factor ZN in Eqs. (16, 22) is merely the squared norm of the un-renormalised output field after N such linear-loss operations.  A polarizer reduces the optical power but never produces a probabilistic heralding event; the state always emerges and is subsequently renormalised.  Hence ZN is not a “success probability”.  \n3. Because ZN scales only as ~1/√N (not exponentially), the extra attenuation (≈3 dB per two steps for the parameters quoted) is comparable to ordinary optical loss and does not by itself render the scheme impractical.  \n4. The authors’ claim of “experimentally feasible” therefore remains intact: feasibility refers to attainable squeezing and optical elements, not to a nonexistent post-selection probability.\n\nThus the alleged “low success probability” problem stems from interpreting ZN incorrectly, so the criticism does not hold.",

In linear optics, inserting a polarizer at 45° transforms polarization to D but discards orthogonal components, resulting in a success probability of 1/2 with single photons. Even though coherent states experience amplitude loss, the normalization keeps the output state valid. I'm noting that Z_N reflects the probability amplitude that transmits. The authors seem to suggest that their approach is deterministic, so criticism of their success probability might not be valid.",

They discuss generating approximate GKP codewords using optical modes, focusing on energy, not just amplitude. The projection through a polarizer results in amplitude scaling but maintains the same shape, just truncated. When they reference \"low success probability,\" I think it’s a misinterpretation. The process acts deterministically, so instead of a critical drop in success rates, the impact is less severe than implied.

In a GI experiment the reconstructed image O(x,y) has a physically fixed scale: it is the (unnormalized) correlation signal in camera-count units.

Equation (1) is simply an RMSE-type metric between the known binary object S(x,y) and the measured correlation image O(x,y). If a filter improves the image (i.e., reduces noise or increases contrast) the term Σ(S–O)² necessarily becomes smaller and the reported SNR rises; this is independent of any further rescaling of O.\n\n3. The paper shows that the 1 nm-filter and the “no-background” cases give almost identical curves, while broader filters give systematically lower SNRs. Had an arbitrary or drifting scale been present, these curves would not line up in this consistent order, nor would the “no-background” reference sit where expected.\n\n4. In practice most GI groups either leave O(x,y) in camera units or (sometimes) divide by a constant factor such as the mean bucket value; either approach keeps a fixed global scale and does not invalidate comparisons.

The step is therefore correct.\n\n3. Even if one prefers to write the volume term as ((R_ℓ^{d₁} R_ι^{d₂})^{1/q}), the subsequent rigorous proof in Section 6 handles the exact exponents carefully; the heuristic misprint (if any) has no impact on the argument.\n\nHence the alleged “critical problem” is only a misunderstanding of the dimensional facts for Métivier groups and of the purely heuristic paragraph; it does not affect the validity of the paper.",

The paper, however, first says these operations take “O(n) in the number of bits” (already a slip: they should say O(B) where B = log n) and then substitutes that O(B) factor by either O(log10 n) or even by O(n) itself when forming the final bounds.

At ≈300 MeV and very small momentum transfer the reaction is governed by the spin–isospin part of the NN force; Coulomb distortions are known (from extensive GT-systematics of (p,n) and (n,p) reactions) to modify forward cross sections by only a few percent even for heavy nuclei.  \n\n2. The authors explicitly test the symmetry assumption with 48Ca (Fig. 3). The observed (p,n)/(p,p′) ratio agrees with the pure‐isospin prediction to within the experimental errors, demonstrating that any residual distortion effects are already inside the quoted uncertainties (≈10 %).  \n\n3. For 208Pb the M1 strength extracted from the present method matches, within errors, the sum of the independent γ-ray and (n,n′γ) data. If large Coulomb-asymmetry corrections were missing the two determinations would disagree conspicuously, which they do not.  \n\n4. The error bars given by the authors (coming from cross-section extrapolation and the unit-cross-section systematics) comfortably cover the size of the possible Coulomb contribution estimated from distorted-wave calculations at this energy (<5 %).

It seems that while Coulomb effects may not be negligible, they primarily affect the elastic scattering amplitude. In inelastic transitions, spin-isospin interaction tends to dominate. The differences in Coulomb corrections between the two reactions stem from the outgoing proton experiencing Coulomb effects, while the outgoing neutron does not, which is a minor effect overall.",

This suggests Coulomb differences in cross sections may be minimal. The authors argue that M1 and GT cross sections relate via an isospin factor while assuming independence from Coulomb. For 208Pb, where Coulomb effects are stronger, I need to evaluate how they could influence the results. It’s crucial to analyze whether neglecting them could lead to significant systematic errors, especially given the observed discrepancies.",

Let’s dive in. For two bosons, their state can be represented by creation operators, where symmetrization occurs naturally. L and R labels relate to modes during injection, yet these are independent. A bosonic operator for path L, combined with one for path R, already creates a symmetric state. However, tracking which particle came from which source is usually lost after mixing. Thus, using L and R as origin indicators gets tricky when it clashes with the principle of indistinguishability. The critique points out a flawed symmetrization method by mixing distinct pairs rather than simply within each pair.",

Thus, the operation accurately represents particle exchange by swapping coordinates, not labels. This confirms the authors’ approach is valid, making the critique misinformed. Hence, the critique doesn't hold. Now, I’ll craft a final response."

For instance, in a centrosymmetric system, a 180° rotation about one axis flips the signs of the other coordinates.

For a non-180° axial heterotwin two crystals share the same invariant direction u (here b), but their interface planes (h k l)₁ and (h k l)₂ differ.  To superimpose the two lattices one in general needs a 180° roto-inversion (i.e. reflection) about the line that is simultaneously  \n • perpendicular to u and  \n • contained in the bisector plane of the two interface normals.  \n\n That axis is therefore not u itself; it is expected to be normal to u.\n\n2. The paper states exactly this: the calculated axis is ~[201], “such that its angle with the direction b is nearly 90° and it lies in the bisector plane of (1̅01) and (001̅).”  In triclinic metrics the “exact” axis is irrational; the orthogonality condition is automatically fulfilled without the additional metric restriction suggested by the objection.\n\n3. A “rotoinversion of 180°” (S₂) is indeed a reflection; describing the misorientation that way is neither ambiguous nor contradictory with the earlier general description—rotation around u is appropriate for the idealized plane-rotation picture (§3.2), while the equivalent reflection description naturally arises from the full lattice correspondence actually computed.\n\nHence the apparent inconsistency arises from a misreading of the geometry, not from an error in the paper.",

      "**Clarifying integral evaluations**\n\nI see that in the product, there are two factors of (1/aσ)² and an additional (aσ)⁻² from each G_R. So we compute thoroughly: G_R = (1/aσ) e^{-p1 Δ}, meaning that each time variable integral includes a factor of (1/aσ). Thus, I1 I2 results in (1/aσ)² times (1/p1)², leading to 1/Y² after some simplification. This confirms the paper’s expression while noting the critic's miscalculation. We also approximate scale factors a²(ρ). Focusing on these points helps me see that the approximation seems valid, even with significant σ values.",

The expression correctly incorporates π_ij a⁴ and a² factors from the double integral. The critic's misleading claim of replacing 1/Y² with 1/(aσY) overlooks the cancellation. Our calculations confirm 1/Y², so it's essential to clarify that the evaluation is accurate, and the critic missed the proper cancellation. The final answer can confidently affirm there's no issue here."

Noise that is already present when the signal leaves Alice is experienced by Bob in exactly the same way as by Eve; it therefore does not give Eve any informational advantage. Consequently the optimal Holevo quantity χ_BE depends only on the channel parameters {T, ξ} and is indeed independent of α². This behaviour has been reported in earlier security analyses (e.g. García-Patrón & Cerf 2006; Navascués et al. 2006).\n\n• In DR the key is extracted from Alice’s data. Preparation noise sits between Alice and Bob, so it does reduce Alice–Bob correlation while being fully visible to Eve. Hence χ_AE acquires an explicit α²–dependence, exactly as the Appendix of the paper shows. Again, this matches the standard literature (cf. Usenko & Filip, Phys. Rev. A 2016).\n\n• Therefore the absence of α² in the RR formulas (Eqs. 34, 40, 41) and its presence in the DR formulas (Eqs. 47, 49-51) is physically consistent rather than contradictory. The source, the channel and Eve’s intervention are the same, but the choice of reconciliation direction changes which party’s variable becomes the reference, and this legitimately changes how trusted source mixedness enters the security bound.\n\nHence the “inconsistency’’ pointed out by your colleague is expected behaviour; it does not indicate an error in the paper.",

No derivation or bound in the paper depends on interpreting ε as a square root of the main error parameter.\n\nTherefore the alleged “inconsistency” does not affect any argument or bound, and the paper remains correct.\n\nSummary: the issue is only cosmetic, not mathematical.\n\n",

Claimed rate.  \n   • The paper consistently states the rate O((Δx)^{1/7}); see the Abstract, Theorem 2.4, and the last lines of the proof.  \n   • It never claims O((Δx)^{1/2}). That number appears only in an intermediate estimate for the viscous‐error E[‖u_ε–u‖] ≤ C √ε, not for the scheme error.\n\n2. Parameter choice.  \n   • In the proof (page 31) the authors set  \n     ε = (Δx)^{2/7}, ξ = (Δx)^{2/7}, δ = (Δx)^{1/7}.  \n   • With these values the potentially dangerous term C ξ/δ equals C (Δx)^{2/7}/(Δx)^{1/7} = C (Δx)^{1/7} → 0, so no O(1) residue occurs.  \n   • All other error terms in (4.24)–(4.27) are of order ≤ C (Δx)^{1/7} as well, so the optimisation is coherent.\n\n3. Combination of errors.  \n   • Scheme error: O((Δx)^{1/7}).  \n   • Viscous error with ε = (Δx)^{2/7}: √ε = (Δx)^{1/7}.  \n   • Adding them still gives the announced O((Δx)^{1/7}) rate.\n\nHence the alleged “critical problem’’ arises from misreading the parameter choice and the paper’s stated rate, not from a flaw in the analysis.",
