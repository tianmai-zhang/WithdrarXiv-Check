Their approach often seems to overlook the necessity of a metric for defining distance and gradient formulas.

While classifying materials as SCL versus classical relies on current γ values, BN should always show higher gain than MgO due to its higher electron affinity. The authors acknowledge that the variables continuously change, and their results are designed to be illustrative. Therefore, I think it’s a false alarm regarding the interpretation of transients as steady states."

Magnitude of the neglected terms – Adding the published rediffusion or true-secondary yields for MgO or BN at these energies would change γ by ≲0.02–0.05, far less than the ~0.2 difference in γ between the two materials that drives the classical vs SCL outcome reported. Thus the qualitative conclusion (BN → SCL, MgO → classical) is unaffected.\n3. Authors’ acknowledgement – The paper openly states the omission, cites Bronold & Fehske, and confines its claims to regimes where back-scatter “dominates the other two”.

      "**Assessing the omission's impact**\n\nThe omission of certain emission channels may not significantly alter γ in low-energy sheaths. While the colleague suggests it could raise γ substantially, analysis shows that low-energy electrons primarily reflect, meaning any additional contribution from rediffused or true secondary electrons would likely be minimal. The authors acknowledge that while these channels might be relevant in future scenarios, their current omission doesn’t critically undermine their conclusions.

Let’s generalize to \\(n = m\\): for a radial \\(Y\\), using a constant bivector like \\(\\partial_i \\wedge \\partial_j\\) could lead to duplicates if \\(Y\\) includes those components.

They also point out additional nodal points suggesting nodal surfaces exist, which complicates their classification as simply nodal nets. While they mention that wavy lines between specific nodes don't negate the existence of a nodal net, the real issue lies with the evidence of nodal surfaces. My colleague's main argument may overlook this critical point.",

I need to determine if my colleague's concerns hold weight, but since nodal lines don't require straightness, their criticism may not be valid."

For this particular space group (I4/mmm) the nodal surface is protected by the combined PT symmetry in the spin-less limit; SOC only removes the extra SU(2) spin-rotation symmetry.  The resulting gap is therefore proportional to the small atomic SOC of carbon and cannot destroy the qualitative electronic structure.  \n3. It is standard and widely accepted in the literature on carbon allotropes (e.g. graphene, graphyne, carbon nodal-line semimetals) to present the band topology without SOC, precisely because SOC is negligible and does not alter the physics appreciably.\n\nThus, neglecting SOC here does not invalidate the main conclusion, and the absence of an explicit SOC calculation does not constitute a critical flaw.",

Some projects accept this limit for user timelines but not for searches. They collected a hefty 622 million tweets across many trends and countries.

If I shrink uv, I wonder if that introduces multiple edges or alters the topological type. In a punctured surface, shrinking uv merges boundary vertices and shortens the boundary cycle by one, but it remains a circle. However, since uv connects existing boundary vertices, this contraction might create two parallel edges, resulting in duplicates. That’s a tangled thought to unravel!",
      "**Evaluating boundary paths and contractions**\n\nAfter contracting, I’m examining if the path along the boundary (from u to v) and the edge uv essentially become loops. For instance, let’s visualize a small boundary cycle with vertices u, w1, w2, and v, along with chord uv. If I merge u and v into x, I might end up with two edges from x to w1 and w2. This could shorten paths and potentially create multiple edges.\n\nI notice that Negami's 1995 work identifies chords as problematic because they could lead to these issues. If chords can’t be shrunk correctly, then misclassifying them as cables could mislead subsequent proofs. I'm considering whether ignoring chords could still allow the arguments to hold. Even when patched to a closed surface, they may still encounter chords as edges.

At one point, they state that each chord meets both (2.1) and (2.2), implying they categorize chords appropriately. However, later, they shift the definitions regarding non-null-homotopic cycles, which has created some confusion.\n\nIt seems they maintain that chords can still be rods despite redefining criteria for nonfacial cycles. While there’s inconsistency, they appear to treat chords as rods consistently. I need to dig deeper into these conditions and their implications for the overall argument.",

They assert these chords belong to a nonfacial 3-cycle, which could make sense. But then I wonder if these chords are indeed null-homotopic, especially in punctured surfaces, where boundaries could be contractible.\n\nThis leads me to realize there's a contradiction because, in their definitions, they say that edges are rods only within non-null-homotopic cycles. However, they still label chords as rods, which raises concerns about errors affecting their broader arguments. This paper seems to have some serious issues!"

Vc is the threshold voltage of a liquid crystal (LC) cell, which typically is about 1 V for a nematic E7 mixture at 10 µm thickness. The threshold voltage does rely on factors like thickness, dielectric anisotropy, and elastic constant.

Their equation for the tilting angle suggests the relationship could involve dimensionless voltage.

I'm curious if the old torus weight spaces could connect to these valuation degrees, suggesting that degree might act linearly on existing torus characters. If so, we'd see duplicates in actions. Also, while they treat the action as a product, the product could have a kernel, leaving orbit dimensions unchanged unless the new action is fundamentally distinct. It's about verifying whether independence holds in this setup.",
      "**Verifying polytope dimensions**\n\nI’m analyzing a situation where λ could equal n·μ for some fixed μ in Z^r. The equation λ - nμ = 0 implies a certain codimension. With r variables plus n, we might think it's r+1 dimensions; this gives r equations. Thus, the polytope dimension seems to be 1. I need to confirm that the weights are not simply proportional to degree for independence. However, since we also see a r-dimensional polytope at n=0 with independent λ values, this could lead to a full r+1 dimensional span generically. So, I think I can conclude that their claims about independence are valid!"

If there's no mechanism to transfer this to other degrees of freedom, that creates a GSL violation. It seems the paper isn't addressing this issue, which is a significant problem. Now, I need to finalize my answer!"

The comparison of 220 times in FLOPs feels misleading since they're not counting the total cost, possibly overlooking the extraction of features. The efficiency claims rely on retrieval speed without considering the additional costs of feature extraction during inference, which might complicate the findings.",

However, using Table V, which looks at the complete pipeline's inference time, shows a ratio closer to about 1.9 times, indicating a significant discrepancy. The claim might give a misleading impression of overall speed, especially since the primary costs mainly stem from CLIP feature extraction rather than the similarity head.

Where LIM is executed.  \n   • LIM’s Q-K-V attention (Θ(Nq Nf) for a video, Θ(Nq Nw) for a caption) is applied once per sample to obtain its cached concept vectors cv and ct.  \n   • After caching, the actual retrieval stage needs only dot-products between (t̃ , ṽ) and between (cv , ct); those dot-products are indeed independent of Nf and Nw and cost O(Nt Nv (1+Nq)).\n\n3. Comparability with baselines.  \n   • Baselines such as X-CLIP and X-Pool perform cross-modal attention for every text–video pair, so their per-pair complexity depends on Nf and/or Nw.  \n   • GLSCL moves its Nf/Nw-dependent cost to a one-time preprocessing step; this is a different (and valid) cost model and is explicitly stated by the authors.\n\n4.

In the real world quarks are present; glueballs would mix with quarkonia and decay rapidly into mesons/photons, so they are not viable long-lived dark-matter candidates.\n\n3.

      "**Clarifying the c2 coefficient**\n\nI’ve realized that when they define σ_m by replacing zetas with truncated sums starting from m, ζ_m(2) remains positive for large but finite m. Thus, c2 doesn't vanish, which isn't problematic. Even as they extend z to complex values, ζ_z(2) is still positive for finite Re(z) > 0. Since the theorem requires non-zero c2 to define μ, they didn’t compute it, but as long as it's positive, it works. The concern about ζ_n(2) being zero for integers is unfounded, so there’s no real issue here."

Purpose of the paper: to demonstrate an efficient algorithm for evaluating the local-operator (LO) energy partition, not to provide definitive spectroscopic assignments.  Any LO analysis necessarily begins with a user-chosen spatial partition; the results are, by construction, conditional on that choice.\n\n2. Physical plausibility of the chosen surface: the parameters in Eq. (29) were selected so that every nucleus belonging to the anthracenyl fragment lies on one side and every nucleus belonging to the CH₂-naphthyl fragment lies on the other (see Fig. 1).  Hence the surface is not “arbitrary” in the chemical sense; it follows the intuitive chromophoric separation.\n\n3. Insensitivity to small displacements: Gaussian AOs are sharply peaked at their nuclear centres; their density in the inter-fragment void is tiny.  Moving the dividing surface by a few tenths of an ångström—while keeping all nuclei on their original sides—changes only the exponentially decaying tails of the basis functions, giving corrections far below the 5–10 % thresholds that the authors use to classify states as “localized” (≥ 90 %) or “non-localized”.  Therefore the qualitative conclusions in Table I are stable.\n\n4. Borderline states already treated cautiously: states whose energy ratios are ∼0.6/0.4 are explicitly labelled “non-localized”.  Any realistic shift of the surface would not make these states cross the 0.9/0.1 localization criterion, so the classification remains unchanged.\n\n5. LO theory itself places no requirement on a specific boundary and does not claim boundary-independent numbers; it delivers fragment energies relative to a user-defined region, exactly as thermodynamic partitioning or charge-analysis schemes do.\n\nBecause the surface is chemically motivated, small perturbations of it would not qualitatively alter the reported energy ratios, and the authors never assert boundary-independent universality.

The generalisation in Theorem 2.6 inherits the same fixed normalisation and is unaffected.\n\nTherefore the alleged “missing factor-of-2” is only an artefact of comparing different metric conventions; the paper is consistent, and the coefficient ½ is correct for the metrics actually used.",

That property by itself, however, is not enough to guarantee fault-tolerance of a logical operation: one must also show that  \n(i) a single faulty physical gate produces at most one correctable error on the block, and  \n(ii) the resulting error remains in the class that the code’s syndrome-extraction procedure can identify and correct.\n\nFor CSS/Steane-like codes these conditions are automatically satisfied for transversal Clifford gates (H, S, CNOT, etc.), because Clifford gates map Pauli errors to Pauli errors, so standard stabiliser measurements still work.  For a generic non-Clifford phase gate P(α) this is no longer true: a single Pauli error entering the gate can exit as a non-Pauli operator (e.g. T X T† ∝ X+Y), which the usual Pauli-syndrome machinery cannot directly diagnose.  Consequently extra techniques (magic-state injection, specialised syndrome extraction, etc.) are normally required to realise non-Clifford phase rotations fault-tolerantly.\n\nIn the manuscript Eq. (4) is declared to implement the logical operation P(α)L transversally, and the text then states that this “is transversal, and hence fault-tolerant,” without any analysis of how errors transform or how the code will correct them.  Moreover, for the seven-qubit Steane code the formula (6) would give a transversal implementation of T = P(π/4), but it is well-known (and implied by the Eastin–Knill theorem) that the Steane code has no transversal T gate; T is usually realised through magic-state injection.

For typical JPEG streams (tens of thousands of bytes) the expected number of stuffed bytes is on the order of a few hundred. The statistical fluctuation caused by replacing VLCs of similar length is a small fraction of that (tens of bytes, i.e. a few hundred bits).\n\n3.

Thus, f_G(q) is unique and branch-independent. The action functional aligns with f_G across all sheets, confirming identical action values.

The extension from 1PI to all graphs raises the question of whether coassociativity is evident. In the original Connes-Kreimer, coassociativity holds due to the definition involving admissible subgraphs.

We should still consider the connectivity conditions included in their definition of subgraphs.

In the linear case with singular integrals, if b_k approaches b in BMO, do the commutators converge in operator norms? This needs clarification, especially for the maximal operator commutator.",
      "**Analyzing boundedness and compactness**\n\nI'm examining the theorem that shows the boundedness from L^{p1}×L^{p2} to L^p relies on a constant multiplied by the BMO norm of b. The authors prove boundedness in a Lipschitz scenario but not in BMO. For compactness, they consider the bilinear Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator under the assumption that b is in CMO. However, issues arise for BMO convergence since differences like (b_k - b) might be unbounded. I'll explore whether operator norms can still be estimated using the BMO norm.",
      "**Evaluating boundedness issues in CMO**\n\nI'm looking into how the maximal commutator interacts with Lipschitz spaces, noticing that BMO might not be sufficient. For the maximal operator, the boundedness condition requires Lipschitz continuity. An earlier paper indicates that the boundedness of the commutator fails for BMO, which is why the Lipschitz assumption was established. While Theorem 1.2 considers functions in CMO, the proof depends on boundedness that isn’t guaranteed for general CMO. This leads me to conclude that there's a valid criticism regarding the compactness argument."

Each n pairs with -n, appearing twice, but when combined, they yield a cosine term that preserves the full weight without double-counting. \n\nNext, for S= Σ_n a_n, I need to ensure proper pairing, particularly for n=0, ensuring that I don’t inadvertently halve contributions further.

This shows that S' matches the original sum, confirming there's no double-counting or halving involved. The R=0 term checks out too. Thus, the colleague's claim appears to be incorrect. I’ll create a concise explanation to summarize this conclusion."

(5) is therefore a standard and adequate way of extracting an h-offset.\n\n2. Whether the fitted slope parameter “T” equals the cryostat temperature is not essential for the calibration.  The offset h0 that is obtained from the fit (the horizontal shift of the tanh) is insensitive to the exact interpretation of T, so the bias-cancellation procedure remains valid even if the device is not in perfect thermal equilibrium.\n\n3. For the Jij study the authors themselves note that the effective temperature returned from the fit “is only a fitting parameter and no longer corresponds to a physically realistic temperature,” so they do not rely on it for any physical conclusion.  They use the fit only to obtain J-offsets, which again depend mainly on the horizontal shift of the curve, not on the temperature parameter.\n\n4.

Even a slope ≈1 in log–log space does not verify the additive identity required by the model, and logging forces exclusion or arbitrary treatment of zero/negative observations.\n3. “Money growth” is not harmonised across 161 countries; cross-country differences in money aggregates add noise that the simple regression cannot control.\n\nHence the reported correlation cannot be taken as valid empirical confirmation of the model.",

There are deficiencies, such as using 55-year averages that overlook time dynamics, confusion from logging rate differences, and issues with negative values and cross-country definitions. This raises the question: does it invalidate the empirical evidence? The paper suggests that the balanced path, c = q − g, should hold within countries over time, but testing averages across countries might not support that. Interestingly, the relationship between growth and GDP could yield negative values, complicating the analysis further.",

While a slope near 1 supports proportionality, it doesn't affirm the difference identity. The critique on logging is arguable but not fatal, yet the larger issue is using averages across countries with varied definitions of money, which seems to weaken the empirical test considerably. So, I conclude that yes, this is a real problem."

A systematic bias in the aperture correction would affect both quantities that appear in the correlation (ΔMS uses SFRHα,corr and Hα/UV contains the same SFRHα,corr).

Because this projection is applied at each of the N steps, the overall (heralded) success probability scales roughly as (1/2)ᴺ, and another factor ≃1/2 is incurred by the final |D⟩ projection used to obtain the codeword.  \n   • For the N = 8 example stressed in the paper the net probability is ≲0.3 %, and it falls rapidly for larger N.  \n4. All subsequent performance figures (e.g. the “P_no error ≈ 0.936” quoted for N = 8) are calculated after renormalising the post-selected state and therefore are conditioned on that very low-probability event.  \n5. The paper does not discuss this exponential overhead or the experimental cost of the necessary repeated trials / heralding, yet it bases its claims of “practical feasibility” and “comparative advantage” on the conditioned numbers.\n\nHence the omission is significant: once the exponentially small success rate is taken into account, the scheme ceases to be practical and its advantage over the standard GKP preparation disappears.",

      "**Evaluating a criticism**\n\nI need to assess whether the critique of the paper is valid. We should look closely at Section II B, where they discuss the dissipative QW coin toss implemented through projective measurement onto |D⟩ for each step. They claim to \"reset\" the coin with projections, making it nonunitary, and mention that projection impacts total probability, necessitating normalization after several steps. However, the critic points out that each step's projection probability is about 1/2, which wasn't included in their performance analysis. I'll need to delve deeper into this.",
      "**Assessing normalization and success probability**\n\nI’m analyzing how projection amplitude behaves, deriving it as (1/2) [ D(∆ξ)+ D(-∆ξ) ]|ψ>. The norm squared indicates probabilities may be influenced by terms, but with squeezed states, overlaps could be small due to large displacement. For the GKP step, this means the success probability roughly becomes (1/2)^N over N steps. They reportedly adjust potential projections within the optical loop, but their normalization seems to not account for the actual success probability, which the critic highlights as a significant oversight.",
      "**Analyzing squeezed vacuum states**\n\nI want to break down the implications of using squeezed vacuum states after polarizers. Each polarizer halves the amplitude, which could reduce the squeezing. The state is polarization-coded, meaning the squeezed vacuum consists of superimposed horizontal and vertical polarizations. When projecting onto a diagonal state, the amplitude changes, possibly degrading the squeezing due to losses. Without measuring or detecting the orthogonal path, they might end with a mixed state instead of a pure one, impacting the expected success probability and overall integrity of the encoding."

Uncertainties in Q or in the time needed to finish circularisation mainly affect the overall efficiency (how many systems succeed), not the ψ distribution conditional on success, which is the key result.  \n• The authors explicitly acknowledge this limitation in Section 4 (“Reducing (increasing) that afinal limit…”) and again note that their efficiency numbers are only illustrative (“this process does not appear to be sufficiently efficient…”).\n\nThus the simplification is recognised and does not invalidate the paper’s qualitative conclusion about the expected obliquity pattern.",

The authors seem to focus more on final obliquity distribution rather than exact predictions of occurrence rates. They do assume efficiencies of tidal interactions, and although simplifications might affect numbers, obliquity distribution results may remain valid. Overall, I think this isn't a critical problem and is more of a standard practice."

Now, I question if the map is Z-linear. For abelian groups, addition aligns, and scaling by integers is preserved, confirming it's Z-linear.

The map \\( t: O \\to \\Delta \\) may not be proper since the fiber of zero could lead to a closed disk's preimage, which isn't necessarily compact. Properness requires closedness and compact fibers. For the multi-variable case with toric coordinates, the mapping appears proper, especially when they address multi-valuedness with specific approaches. However, there seems to be a gap in the provided proofs, particularly referencing other papers. Overall, it suggests that there might not be a significant issue, but further verification is needed."

Quality of the symmetry at 300 MeV:  \n   The (p,n) “unit–cross-section” method, on which Eq.(4) is patterned, has been tested for many nuclei up to 208Pb (e.g. Taddeucci et al., Sasano et al.).  At incident energies ≃300 MeV and q≈0 the strong interaction dominates and Coulomb distortions are known to modify absolute cross sections by ≤10 %.  This level of accuracy is built into the quoted uncertainty of the unit cross section [Eq.(5)].\n\n2. Isospin mixing in 208Pb:  \n   Although 208Pb is heavy, its ground state has a large isospin T=22; Coulomb-induced mixing with T ± 1 states is therefore suppressed (mixing amplitudes ≲1 %).  Such small corrections cannot generate the ≈40 % extra B(M1) strength that the paper reports above 8 MeV.\n\n3. Empirical consistency check:  \n   Below 8 MeV the B(M1) distribution extracted from the present (p,p′) data (16.0 ± 1.2 µN²) agrees with the sum of high-resolution (γ,γ′) + (n,n′γ) results (14.8⁺¹·⁹₋¹·⁵ µN²).  If Coulomb/optical-potential effects were as large as claimed, this agreement could not be achieved.\n\n4. Precedent of 48Ca:  \n   The authors explicitly verify the symmetry assumption for 48Ca by comparing the measured (p,p′) and (p,n) angular distributions; the required 2.57 scale factor from Eq.(4) reproduces the (p,n) data almost perfectly, demonstrating that distortion effects are indeed negligible at the chosen kinematics.\n\n5. Error budget:  \n   Any residual Coulomb or optical-potential difference would enter as an additional systematic uncertainty (of order 10 %), already comparable to the quoted total error bars; it does not invalidate the method nor can it mimic the newly observed strength.\n\nHence the assumption of isospin symmetry, while approximate, is sufficiently accurate for the purpose of the analysis, and no evidence indicates that it artificially produces the extra strength in 208Pb.",

This could mean the authors’ assumptions might not hold. They relate the unit cross section of spin-M1 in (p,p') to GT in (p,n), testing this with 48Ca and showing excellent agreement. However, they lack an explicit test for 208Pb and suggest distortion effects are negligible at around 300 MeV. I need to think: are these truly negligible?",
      "**Analyzing hadronic interactions**\n\nAt 300 MeV, hadronic interactions dominate, and while Coulomb distortions are minor, there's a difference between proton and neutron scattering. Protons face a Coulomb barrier in (p,p') but not in (p,n), which could slightly modify the cross sections. The unit cross section approach is common for charge-exchange reactions, with uncertainties around 10-20%. Many studies show that isospin symmetry holds for certain energy ranges. For 208Pb, the predicted cross-section ratio decreases due to certain factors, and they find strong agreement with prior results, suggesting claims of serious problems may be exaggerated, especially concerning isospin mixing.",
      "**Assuring isospin symmetry**\n\nHigh T (22) retains beneficial quantum numbers, so matrix element approximations should hold. The Coulomb distortion differences due to entrance and exit channels at 295 MeV are small because of high velocity and minimal deflection. They used a method to evaluate cross section shapes, avoiding uncertainties through unit cross-section approaches. Therefore, I can confidently say, “No, it is a false alarm.” Overall, at 300 MeV and forward angles, isospin symmetry remains within 10% even in heavy nuclei, which the authors validated for 48Ca and showed minimal Coulomb mixing in 208Pb."

(11) the authors keep r1 inside the outer expectation and only separate expectations over independent random objects:\n        E[ e^{-Θr1^α(Ired,P+Ione,Si)} ]  \n        = E_{r1}[ E_{r m ,Ired,P}[e^{-Θr1^α Ired,P}] · E_{k,Ione,Si}[e^{-Θr1^α Ione,Si}] ].\n\n    This uses (i) independence between the primary and secondary point processes and (ii) the Poisson independence noted above; no unjustified factorisation is made.\n\n3.  The subsequent Laplace transforms (Eq. 12–13) are evaluated conditionally on r m (for Ired,P) and on k (for Ione,Si), and the double integral in Eq. (14) correctly employs the conditional pdf f_{r m | r1}(·).\n\nHence the independence assumptions employed are legitimate for a PPP with distance-based path-loss, and the mathematical development that follows is consistent.",

While each RB is uniquely allocated to at most one secondary, outside secondary nodes can use the same RB. This could underestimate interference, especially if external secondaries are prevalent. It's interesting to evaluate how these assumptions might affect overall network performance.",

The centralized decision-making minimizes concerns about correlated sensing. So, I think the assumption is plausible and the critique may misunderstand the model's design."

Even with symmetrization involved, calculations using either method should yield consistent results.",
      "**Assessing initial states**\n\nI'm examining how they treat the initial state as a product of two orthogonal components. Even though they label their states L and R, which distinguishes them, this distinction only matters until overlap occurs. At that point, they separate into symmetric and antisymmetric parts, based on path indistinguishability rather than the initial symmetry. Given that the initial state is effectively symmetric and product-like, I don't see a critical problem that undermines their results. Using a factorizable form makes sense since the particles occupy orthogonal modes, and symmetrization correctly applies when necessary."

Hence the total degree with respect to the first variable is the constant 2, independent of k, exactly as required in (7.12)/(7.6).\n\n• The polynomials that arise from Faà-di-Bruno formulas (those denoted Qk , Rk , …) may indeed have degrees growing with k, but they depend on higher-order norms of X, not on the “first variable’’ itself. After X is replaced by h0(σ–ρ), they are absorbed in Pk without increasing the power of ‖σ–ρ‖ that is outside. This is the same mechanism already used (and accepted) in Conn’s, Miranda-Monnier-Zung’s and other Nash–Moser proofs.\n\n• Because the smallness hypothesis imposes ‖σ–ρ‖≪1, any extra k-dependent factors inside Pk are harmless for the convergence of the Newton–type iteration; the uniform quadratic contraction is governed by the external square.\n\nTherefore Lemma 5.8 satisfies the hypothesis of the abstract Theorem 7.2/7.6, and the iterative scheme converges.

In this purely prestellar phase observational and theoretical studies (e.g. Masunaga & Inutsuka 2000; Keto & Caselli 2010) show that efficient CO, dust and gas cooling keeps the gas nearly isothermal (≈7–12 K) up to central H₂ densities of 10⁷–10⁸ cm⁻³. The highest densities reached in the run are within this range, so a single 11 K temperature is acceptable for the dynamics.\n\n2. Impact on level populations At 10 K the lower HCO⁺ and N₂H⁺ levels considered lie well within the linear part of the Boltzmann factor; changing T by a few kelvin alters the J = 1–0 and 3–2 level populations and opacities by only tens of percent, not orders of magnitude. The lines remain optically thick and self-absorbed, so the basic blue–skewed morphology survives.\n\n3. Key conclusion relies on kinematics The paper’s “under-estimation factor” arises because the velocity field is outside-in: the highest speeds sit in low-density gas and are down-weighted in the emergent profile. That geometric/kinematic effect is largely independent of modest temperature gradients; raising T in the centre would, if anything, strengthen the optical contrast and preserve (or enhance) the bias they describe.\n\nTherefore the constant-temperature assumption is a simplification but not a critical flaw that invalidates their main result.",

Observational data shows dust temperatures between 7-15 K, which suggests the isothermal assumption might be reasonable. Additionally, temperature variations wouldn’t significantly affect the optical depth needed to explain the underestimation due to density and velocity weighting.",

While asymmetry in the profile comes from radiative transfer, the effects remain as long as lines are optically thick and show self-absorption. Increased central temperature might heighten brightness differences but won't drastically change ratios. Moreover, studies suggest that central temperatures around 10 K persist until higher densities form. This means initial assumptions about temperature are likely valid. So, the earlier complaint seems to be a false alarm."

While they may not have tested λ > 1, the arrival intensity is still relevant. The claim of a 2.5× improvement in performance under heavy load suggests that the paper has merit. So, the assertion that they only focus on low to moderate loads seems misleading. Overall, it's a false alarm regarding the criticism."

      "**Analyzing holonomy groupoid amenability**\n\nI need to examine the holonomy groupoid of a foliation, particularly noting that while the interior may not be amenable, it still remains significant. The pair groupoid occurs in trivial foliation cases but is non-amenable for general foliations. This undermines the assumptions about amenability throughout the paper. Although the authors might apply a canonical projection approach without assuming injectivity, their treatment of maximal and reduced C*-algebras lacks clarity. Therefore, I conclude that the problem regarding the assumption of amenability is indeed valid, as it’s crucial for their identification."

Processing artefacts caused by a particular self-cal/continuum-subtraction run would not reproducibly appear in a second, independent observation.\n\n2. Line-specific behaviour: Only the spectral windows that contain known molecular transitions show the ∼10 mJy features; other zoom bands reduced identically remain line-free at the ≲1 mJy level. Calibration or subtraction errors would manifest across all bands.\n\n3. Consistent multi-line picture: The blueshifted emission is present in two unrelated species (CH₃OH and CH₂NH) and absorption is present at the same velocities in all four 6 GHz OH lines, while the recombination lines peak at the systemic velocity. A continuum-processing artefact would not selectively mimic this coherent chemical/kinematic pattern.\n\n4. Amplitude scale: The continuum is ∼2.5 Jy; the detected lines are ≤0.5 % of that. Standard ATCA self-cal solutions are stable at the 0.1 % level, so residuals of the required amplitude are unlikely, and any such residuals would be continuum-like (broad, flat), not confined to a 350 km s⁻¹ velocity range.\n\n5. Baseline check: On long baselines (to antenna 6) the lines disappear while the continuum remains, demonstrating that the features are spatially resolved emission/absorption, not subtraction ripples.\n\nTaken together, these points convincingly rule out processing artefacts as the origin of the reported weak, broad lines.",

Strong lines used independent calibrators and adapted an observing strategy of 10 minutes on target, with a 2-minute phase calibrator. The line detection sensitivity raises questions about the impact of residual errors on signal integrity.",

This independent dataset aligns with earlier findings, revealing no emission around antenna 6, indicating the emission extends beyond 2”. However, I worry about potential artifacts from continuum subtraction affecting broad spectral features. Yet, both methanimine and OH lines also reveal similar emissions despite their different frequencies. They employed self-cal and integrated line-free channels, which should mitigate issues, though the line shapes remain consistent with low amplitude.",

      "**Analyzing Theorem 3.4 Justifications**\n\nI recall that the paper assumes bounded support or sub-exponential decay for entries but also considers a wider range. They analyze singular values within the upper half-plane of a Hermitized matrix, which might allow for real parts to be more significant than initially stated. Theorem 3.4 seems to address a broader domain for w than just near-zero. I need to look into whether polynomial tails versus sub-exponential tails are appropriately justified, especially in the context of high moments and previous works.",
      "**Evaluating Proposition 2.7 and Theorem 3.4**\n\nThe local law seems to require subexponential tails, but it can be extended with truncation methods. While I think Theorem 3.4 initially imposes this condition, the authors suggest it can be relaxed to allow finite moments, which raises questions about their reliance on this assumption. The definition of the spectral variable w allows for larger real parts without breaking the local law, indicating that the concerns may be unfounded. Overall, Proposition 2.7 appears to stand, with the necessary details being quite standard."

Since A_r is normal in A, I can restrict to irreducible modules for A_r.\n\nI'm also considering the action of A_r, which might involve unipotent matrices and could lead to irreducible modules when examining stable subspaces, such as when A_r acts on a vector space using Jordan blocks.",

(This is standard and does not need the particular extension operator quoted.)  \n• Hence we can take g to be that zero-extension of ρ1−ρ2 and set  \n\n  ρ̃₂(x)=ρ₂(x) (x∈U), ρ̃₂(x)=any W^{1,p} extension outside U;  \n  ρ̃₁=ρ̃₂+g.\n\nThen ρ̃₁, ρ̃₂ are W^{1,p}(ℝⁿ) extensions of ρ₁, ρ₂ and satisfy ρ̃₁=ρ̃₂ on ℝⁿ\\U, so q₁−q₂ is indeed compactly supported.  \n\nThus Corollary 8 is correct; only the text’s reference to the specific extension operator is superfluous, not fatal.",

This leads me to question whether membership in the function space is indeed required for the extensions to coincide outside a defined region.",

For bounded Lipschitz domains, this assumption typically holds. The trace operator connects to this space, indicating that such a difference indeed falls into W^{1,p}_0(U). \n\nNow, regarding the extension operator E, it should match with the zero-extension if the function comes from W^{1,p}_0(U). I need to consider how extension properties interact with functions outside U, especially around preserving boundary conditions.",

They assert that E behaves like this, relying on certain theorems, but I need to verify whether those theorems guarantee the necessary properties, particularly when dealing with Lipschitz domains.",

While typical extensions don’t necessarily vanish outside a region, I need the extension of the difference to do so. The corollary they claim is sustainable using zero extension instead of E, which is where I see some uncertainty. If E doesn’t vanish outside, the equality they propose could fail. However, I’ve reasoned that we can achieve positivity and preserve the necessary properties with proper zero extension. Thus, the concerns raised seem minor, and the statement holds true."

The equilibrium potential would be negative, around -1.5 MeV, to attract protons and repel electrons, stabilizing the system. \n\nThis suggests macros quickly reach equilibrium around this negative potential, which will help inform capture rates.

At around -1.5 MeV, macros should reach an equilibrium charge quickly, making assumptions about constant potential reasonable during Baryogenesis. \n\nIn cases with very small cross-sections, the impact may be negligible, supporting the robustness of their derived constraints.

They compute constraints for varying values, yet they overlook the role of electrons. Since electrons are abundant and massive, their absorption could significantly affect net charge and potential. If macros absorb protons, they should attract electrons to maintain neutrality. However, they might also be repelled due to interactions, which raises questions about the assumptions made in the study. I should dive deeper into the implications of ignoring electrons.",

Their results still hold for macros that may evolve toward zero potential. The critique suggests that not including electrons disrupts charge neutrality. However, while macros capturing positive baryons might become positively charged, the universe remains neutral because of the electron sea. Therefore, it’s unnecessary to include electrons in the simulation. I believe the critique is not critical and largely misunderstanding the authors’ approach. Let’s clarify this in a final explanation!"

The claim of it being an over-restriction lacks support, as this condition aligns with the nature of double collinear singularities.

For Fe8, the ground state has a small tunneling splitting but can be enhanced under certain conditions. They might assume λ to be small, but I wonder if their approximation holds true given the literature on SMMs. It's tricky to determine if the critique identifies a genuine issue or is just an overreaction.",

The critique suggests λ may exceed Δ; however, since mixing occurs only when coupled to higher energy levels, I’d conclude that this concern isn't critical. Overall, I’d say it’s more of a false alarm than a real problem."

Those auxiliary modes can be taken to be in the vacuum without loss of generality, because any Gaussian state of the environment (thermal, squeezed, etc.) can be produced from vacuum by a local symplectic transformation, which can be absorbed into Eve’s overall symplectic matrix S.  Starting from vacuum ancillae and allowing an arbitrary three-mode symplectic S therefore already spans the full set of collective Gaussian attacks.\n\n3. Consequently, the authors’ choice (Fig. 2, p. 10) to give Eve exactly two vacuum ancilla modes is not a restriction; it is the minimal universal dilation.

To show w.l.s.c. under weak H¹ convergence, we have the first term behaving as expected due to the weak lower semicontinuity of the L² norm.

This undermines the claim of uniform convergence for the entire sequence. We need to explore if we can still achieve boundedness and some convergence to deduce weak lower semicontinuity. While we know weak convergence in H¹ might imply strong convergence in L² under certain conditions, it doesn't guarantee pointwise convergence. The authors seem to be misusing the entire sequence assumption. We can obtain the needed results through a suitable subsequence.",

I can extract a strongly convergent subsequence in C⁰. For the second term's weak lower semicontinuity, we can apply dominated convergence, ensuring our arguments hold despite potential issues around measure zero. Thus, the theorem stands, and it appears the problem may be a misunderstanding."

In metric fixed point theory, I know there's a minimal invariant weakly compact convex set for nonexpansive mappings in Banach spaces, but these sets can be non-separable.

This challenges the separability of minimal weakly compact convex sets. I recall Karlovitz’s work, which states that in separable Banach spaces, minimal weakly compact convex T-invariant sets are separable, but that's under certain conditions. Testing examples, especially involving nonexpansive mappings, gets complicated as I contemplate weakly compact properties. There's a lot to unpack here!",

There's potential for separability, but complexities arise with nonexpansive mappings. It’s a bit tangled, and I need to clarify how minimal sets fit into this!"

Consequently\n\n\\[\n|J_6^{(4)}|\\;\\lesssim\\;\n\\xi^{-11/4}\\,\\delta_0^{\\,1/4},\n\\]\n\nso for every fixed \\( \\xi>0 \\) the term tends to zero when \\( \\delta_0\\downarrow 0 \\).\nThe authors do indeed send \\( \\delta_0\\to0 \\) before letting \\( \\xi\\to0 \\); hence no\nuniform-in-\\( \\xi \\) estimate is required.  The other parts of \\(J_6\\) are handled\nin the same way, all containing at least one positive power of \\( \\delta_0 \\) that\nkills the possible blow-up of the convolution derivatives.  Therefore\n\n1.  The stochastic Fubini interchange is legitimate.\n2.  The limits \\( \\delta_0\\to0,\\;\\kappa\\to0,\\;l\\to0 \\) are justified without any\n    additional uniform \\(L^{2}\\)-bounds on \\( \\partial_{xx}u_\\varepsilon^\\kappa \\).\n\nHence the criticism that the estimates (4.16)–(4.17) diverge and invalidate the\ncancellation in (4.19) is unfounded.",

      "**Reassessing the computation**\n\nI’m looking into the Hölder inequality and trying to evaluate some bounds. If I assume the fourth moment of σ is bounded, a term involves δ0, which seems to lead to divergence as δ0 approaches zero. However, I might have miscalculated, as integrating over some measures might change things. Redefining some components brings clarity: it suggests that when I simplify and integrate correctly, the bounds tend towards zero for fixed values, indicating no divergence. That’s a promising direction!",
      "**Clarifying uniform integrability**\n\nI realize that uniform integrability for ∂xx uκ_ε isn't necessary since they can work around it with the δ0 factor. This suggests I may have been overly cautious or mistaken in my initial assessment, leading me to think there was a potential issue. It’s reassuring to uncover this detail, as it indicates that the concerns I had were likely unfounded. I’ll keep this in mind moving forward as I evaluate similar situations!"
