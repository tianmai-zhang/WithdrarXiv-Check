The retraction comments suggest a foundational issue that invalidates the whole argument, including potential misidentification of dimensions.

The retraction comments indicate a misidentification: the C*-algebra investigated doesn't correspond to the quantum symplectic sphere as initially thought, leading to a dimensional mismatch.

Given the nuances, it seems prudent to conclude that their issue aligns with the retraction’s comments. We need to confirm this clearly."
