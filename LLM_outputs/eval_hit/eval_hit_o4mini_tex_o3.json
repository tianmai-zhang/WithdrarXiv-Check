The colleague pointed out that no Riemannian metric was specified and that they used a Cartan-Schouten affine connection, which isn’t metric-compatible and thus invalidates optimization. This aligns with the retraction, claiming the flaw lies in the existence of the Riemannian metric. It looks like the problems are indeed the same. So, I’d conclude “Yes.”"

This aligns with the retraction's claim that the notion of stabilizing ordinal is poorly defined. They're both pointing out flaws in definitions 14 and 4.2, suggesting a potential overlap. However, there might be different issues at play, and without full context, I can't be absolutely certain. So, I'll opt for caution and dig deeper into the definitions.",

This aligns with the colleague's assertion that there's no proof K^ξ_F(g) stabilizes. While the colleague’s definition 4.2 could relate to the retraction's mention of definition 14, both suggest that the concepts of stabilization lack justification.

My colleague talks about invariants, but the retraction points to coefficients, indicating that what matters is the equality after projection to coinvariants. It seems both cases face a similar problem: establishing equality tends to only work for coinvariants, not coefficients. We'll need to confirm if there are alternative issues at play.",

It's complicated, though, because it seems equation 5.11 might correspond to equation 35 in a previous version of the paper.

      "**Weighing evidence of objectives**\n\nI’m considering a retraction comment suggesting that the objective allows for trivial solutions, similar to a colleague’s standpoint. I’m trying to clarify what is meant by “trivial solutions,” specifically if choosing the prior as q results in an optimal objective. The colleague's view states the objective may diverge without necessarily indicating the prior is optimal. It also seems there could be an underlying issue regarding the objective not being ELBO. I'll need to further investigate this transformation discussed.",

Now, let's look at the true ELBO, which involves \\( q(ω) \\) and the logs, and see if a wrong bound could arise. There might be ambiguity about trivial solutions, possibly uniform \\( q(ω) \\). I'm curious if this relates to the colleague's earlier explanation and the retraction comment. It seems likely, but I need to be cautious with how I interpret these terms.",
      "**Examining the objective flaws**\n\nIt seems like the objective is indeed flawed, but that doesn’t automatically mean the bound is looser than the ELBO. Choosing the prior might yield a 0 result, possibly due to not subtracting KL. The colleague mentions that the inequality applies only to Bernoulli weights. The retraction comment refers to the objective allowing for trivial solutions, indicating there’s no guarantee of a proper approximation of the model posterior, which aligns with what my colleague said. So, I’m leaning toward “Yes” on being the same issue, but I need to clarify potential nuances."

      "**Evaluating errors in transformation**\n\nI’m looking at whether the colleague's problem matches the errors in the retraction comment. The colleague mentions an unjustified assumption about multiplicities and fusion coefficients, incorrect mapping, and issues with the S-transformation. Meanwhile, the retraction highlights errors in determining S-transformation coefficients and incorrect linear spaces assigned to surfaces. It seems like the core issues may overlap, especially since both explanations touch on open and closed sector mapping and the S-transformation process. I need to dig deeper to see if they align.",
      "**Clarifying retraction issues**\n\nThe retraction comment highlights errors in the S-transformation related to characters and assigned linear spaces, suggesting that a clear definition for open sector spaces is needed. However, the colleague's point focuses more on identifying multiplicities, not directly about characters as products. This overlaps with the retraction's note on linear space errors but isn't exactly the same. Since the retraction discusses a broader range of issues without specifically addressing multiplicity equality, I think the best response is \"No\" due to uncertainty, but with further explanation."
