1611.09506v2,1611.09506v1,Algebraic Geometry (math.AG),On the existence of Ulrich bundles on geometrically ruled surfaces,"Let $S$ be a geometrically ruled surface with invariant $e$ on a curve $C$. We deal with Ulrich line bundles and $\mu$-stable special Ulrich bundles of rank $2$ on $S$ when $e\ge0$, slightly extending a recent result due to M. Aprodu, L. Costa and R.M. Mir_-Roig. If $C$ is elliptic, we also prove that $S$ always supports Ulrich bundles of rank at most $2$, without any restriction on $e$. Finally, we show that in many cases $S$ supports families of dimension $p$ of pairwise non-isomorphic, indecomposable, Ulrich bundles for arbitrary large $p$.",This paper has been withdrawn by the author due to a mistake in the proof of Theorem 1.3 which is not true in the form indicated in the paper. The paper will be resubmitted after a complete revision,13
1802.03831v3,1802.03831v2,Logic (math.LO),Algorithmic Randomness For Amenable Groups,We develop the theory of algorithmic randomness for the space $A^G$ where $A$ is a finite alphabet and $G$ is a computable amenable group. We give an effective version of the Shannon-McMillan-Breiman theorem in this setting. We also extend a result of Simpson equating topological entropy and Hausdorff dimension. This proof makes use of work of Ornstein and Weiss which we also present.,The proof of theorem 7 is incorrect - it only shows the desired result on a computable subsequence,16

Then $\Lambda$ is $\tau$-tilting finite if and only if $\Lambda$ is representation-finite.,Main result is incorrect due to a misapplication of Proposition 2.7. Counterexamples have been found,7
2307.11501v2,2307.11501v1,Analysis of PDEs (math.AP),The lack of exponential stability of a Bresse system subjected only to two dampings,"In this paper, we study the indirect boundary stabilization of a Bresse system with only two dissipation laws. This system, which models the dynamics of a beam, is a hyperbolic system with three wave speeds. We study the asymptotic behaviour of the eigenvalues and of the eigenvectors of the underlying operator in the case of three distinct wave velocities which is not physically relevant. Since the imaginary axis is proved to be an asymptote for one family of eigenvalues, the stability can not be exponential. Of course, this paper is only interesting from a mathematical point of view.",We have realized that Theorem 2.4 is not correct,18

(Incidence divisor is insignificant. Theorem 5.1 is significant,  but the proof of it presented here  is incorrect.)",The proof of theorem 5.1 is incorrect,17
1209.1033v3,1209.1033v2,Information Theory (cs.IT),The Annealing Sparse Bayesian Learning Algorithm,In this paper we propose a two-level hierarchical Bayesian model and an annealing schedule to re-enable the noise variance learning capability of the fast marginalized Sparse Bayesian Learning Algorithms. The performance such as NMSE and F-measure can be greatly improved due to the annealing technique. This algorithm tends to produce the most sparse solution under moderate SNR scenarios and can outperform most concurrent SBL algorithms while pertains small computational load.,"The paper contains some serious flaws. The update equation in the annealing process is too empirical to suit practical usage. The performance comparison is somewhat biasing due to the selection of the convergence critia. This paper need to be revised in order to be printed on the arxiv.org. I am sorry for the inconvenience. [REDACTED-NAME], 2013-03-07",4
2401.01246v2,2401.01246v1,Quantum Physics (quant-ph),Analysis of quantum Krylov algorithms with errors,"This work provides an error analysis of quantum Krylov algorithms based on real-time evolutions, subject to generic errors in the outputs of the quantum circuits. We establish a collective noise rate to summarize those errors, and prove that the resulting errors in the ground state energy estimates are leading-order linear in that noise rate. This resolves a misalignment between known numerics, which exhibit this linear scaling, and prior theoretical analysis, which only provably obtained square-root scaling. Our main technique is expressing generic errors in terms of an effective target Hamiltonian studied in an effective Krylov space. These results provide a theoretical framework for understanding the main features of quantum Krylov errors.","There is an error in eq. (26) of v1 that invalidates the main result.

2209.05150v2,2209.05150v1,Machine Learning (cs.LG),Bounding The Rademacher Complexity of Fourier Neural Operator,"A Fourier neural operator (FNO) is one of the physics-inspired machine learning methods. In particular, it is a neural operator. In recent times, several types of neural operators have been developed, e.g., deep operator networks, GNO, and MWTO. Compared with other models, the FNO is computationally efficient and can learn nonlinear operators between function spaces independent of a certain finite basis. In this study, we investigated the bounding of the Rademacher complexity of the FNO based on specific group norms. Using capacity based on these norms, we bound the generalization error of the FNO model. In addition, we investigated the correlation between the empirical generalization error and the proposed capacity of FNO. Based on this investigation, we gained insight into the impact of the model architecture on the generalization error and estimated the amount of information about FNO models stored in various types of capacities.","there exist serious mathematical error in proofs, we interchanged supremum and expectation but in general, this does not hold",25
1504.01336v3,1504.01336v2,Symplectic Geometry (math.SG),Generating families and constructible sheaves,"Let $\Lambda$ be a Legendrian in the jet space of some manifold $X$. To a generating family presentation of $\Lambda$, we associate a constructible sheaf on $X \times \mathbb{R}$ whose singular support at infinity is $\Lambda$, and such that the generating family homology is canonically isomorphic to the endomorphism algebra of this sheaf. That is, the theory of generating family homology embeds in sheaf theory, and more specifically in the category studied in [STZ]. When $X = \mathbb{R}$, i.e., for the theory of Legendrian knots and links in the standard contact $\mathbb{R}^3$, we use ideas from the proof of the h-cobordism theorem to show this embedding is an equivalence. Combined with the results of [NRSSZ], this implies in particular that the generating family homologies of a knot are the same as its linearized Legendrian contact homologies.","As pointed out to me by [REDACTED-NAME], the main argument fails to account for higher stable homotopy obstructions to simplifying Morse functions. [REDACTED-NAME] and I are preparing an account of what is actually true.

1207.5888v2,1207.5888v1,Group Theory (math.GR),Ergodic theorems for affine actions of amenable groups on Hilbert space,"We prove a new weak mean ergodic theorem (Theorem A) for 1-cocycles associated to weakly mixing representations of amenable groups. Let $G$ be a finitely generated, discrete, amenable group $G$ which admits a controlled Folner sequence. We use Theorem A to deduce that any affine action $G\ca^T \Cal H$ on Hilbert space with weakly mixing linear part admits a sequence of almost fixed points (Theorem B). Specializing to the case that $G$ is a finitely generated group of polynomial growth, we show that convex combinations of averages of the associated 1-cocycle over $n$-balls provide a sequence of almost fixed points for the action $G\ca^T \Cal H$ (Corollary C). This affirms a weak form of a conjecture of Shalom independently of Gromov's theorem on the virtual nilpotency of groups of polynomial growth. As a consequence, we are able to give a new, elementary, ergodic-theoretical proof of Gromov's theorem.","The paper has been withdrawn.

The approach includes two basic stages. In the first stage using DEA models the interval cross-efficiency values of each DMU are specified. In the second stage, the interval pairwise comparison matrix generated in the first stage is utilized to rank the units (DMUs) via the one step process of interval AHP (i.e. the AHP model with interval decision maker judgements). The numerical example is presented in this paper and we compare our approach with some other approaches.",This paper has been withdrawn by the author due to a crucial error in equation 8,17

Finally, we illustrate the relation between these transforms by deriving new formulas.",This paper has been withdrawn by the author due to a crucial error in Theorem 2.1,8
1410.7944v2,1410.7944v1,Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con),Vortex dynamics and specific heat of type II superconductor with quasi-periodic geometry,"The vortex dynamics and the specific heat of a type II superconducting system with quasi-periodic geometry is studied theoretically for different values of interaction parameters using the numerical simulation technique, where the vortex-vortex interaction potential is considered in the form of the modified Bessel's function of first kind. The dynamics of the system is analysed by phase space trajectories of the vortex for both high and low values as well as for both high and low mismatch of vortex-vortex and vortex-pinning interaction parameters. The specific heat variation with temperature is analysed statistically for different values of interaction parameters. It is observed that for low values and lower mismatch of interaction parameters, the system is highly chaotic and shows a bifurcation pattern similar to Hopf bifurcation. The specific heat also shows a highly divergent character in this situation. However for high values and higher mismatch, the superconducting system tends to be a very regular one. The trajectory of the vortices will also be very stable in this situation. Similar situations are also observed respectively for low and high values of the quasi-periodic parameter.","We want to withdraw this paper, because there is a serious conceptual problem in deriving the equation 6",8

We partially order this family by inclusion to form the lattice \Sigma(M), and focus on the sublattice Z of topologies that induce the Euclidean metric space on every time axis and every space axis. We analyze the bounds of Z in the lattice \Sigma(M), in search for its supremum. Our conclusion --that such a supremum does not belong in Z-- is compared with constructive proofs of existence of the fine topology, defined as the maximum of Z and conceived to play an essential role in contemporary physical theories. Essential mathematical and physical questions arise.","This paper has been withdrawn by the author due to a substancial error in equation 25, which does not hold true",22
1812.00349v2,1812.00349v1,Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO),A Logic for Recursive Quantum Programs,"Most modern (classical) programming languages support recursion. Recursion has also been successfully applied to the design of several quantum algorithms and introduced in a couple of quantum programming languages. So, it can be expected that recursion will become one of the fundamental paradigms of quantum programming. Several program logics have been developed for verification of non-recursive quantum programs. However, there are as yet no general methods for reasoning about recursive procedures in quantum computing. We fill the gap in this paper by presenting a logic for recursive quantum programs. This logic is an extension of quantum Hoare logic for quantum While-programs. The (relative) completeness of the logic is proved, and its effectiveness is shown by a running example: fixed-point Grover's search.","There are errors in Section 4, i.e., the definition of quantum predicate terms should be repaired. There are also notational abuses",29

Both trial and test functions have a stochastic component. We give sufficient conditions on the the data and on the covariance operator associated to the driving Wiener process, in order to have existence and uniqueness of the solution. We also show the relation of the obtained solution to the so-called mild solution and to the variational solution of the same problem. The spatial regularity of the solution is also discussed. Two possible semidiscretizations, first a spatial approximation based on a standard finite element method, then a temporal approximation, based on continuous piecewise linear test functions and piecewise constant trial functions, are finally introduced. Error estimates in terms of the best error and of the quasi-optimality constant are presented for both semidiscretizations.",This paper has been withdrawn by the author due to a crucial inaccuracy in treating the noise term: the formulation presented neglects the noise and reduces to a formulation for a random pde,20
1510.06108v3,1510.06108v2,Systems and Control (eess.SY),A Counter-Example Guided Framework for Robust Synthesis of Switched Systems Using Control Certificates,"In this article, the problem of synthesizing switching controllers is considered through the synthesis of a ""control certificate"". Control certificates include control barrier and Lyapunov functions, which represent control strategies, and allow for automatic controller synthesis. Our approach encodes the controller synthesis problem as quantified nonlinear constraints. We extend an approach called Counterexample Guided Inductive Synthesis (CEGIS), originally proposed for program synthesis problems, to solve the resulting constraints. The CEGIS procedure involves the use of satisfiability-modulo theory (SMT) solvers to automate the problem of synthesizing control certificates. In this paper, we examine generalizations of CEGIS to attempt a richer class of specifications, including reach-while-stay with obstacles and control under disturbances. We demonstrate the ability of our approach to handle systems with nonpolynomial dynamics as well. The abilities of our general framework are demonstrated through a set of interesting examples. Our evaluation suggests that our approach is computationally feasible, and adds to the growing body of formal approaches to controller synthesis.",The paper has been withdrawn by the author. The main reason is incorrect proof of Theorem 4 and some incorrect results in the evaluation parts due to some bugs in the code,13

Our key assumption will be that at least two vector fields only differ on the resources allocated to the growth rate of the first species. We will show that the existence of a positive equilibrium of the average vector field is equivalent to the persistence of all species. Under this condition, the semi-group converges exponentially quickly to a unique invariant probability measure on the positive orthant. On the other hand, if this condition fails to hold, a group of species will become extinct exponentially quickly while the distribution of the remaining species will converge to another invariant probability measure.",There is an error.

A step change in the sound velocity, for propagation in the basal plane, is observed at the critical field, Bc2. This step broadens considerably as T tends to Tc with a concomitant decrease in magnitude. A second step is observed at a field ~0.5 Bc2 and it's magnitude remains constant at all temperatures. Inductive measurements of the transitions in a magnetic field, however, exhibit a single signature which coincides with the lower step with no discernible in-phase signature at the upper transition. Measurements performed with B oriented at various angles between the a and c-axes reveal a weaker angular dependence of the lower step and confirm the rapid fall off of Bc2 close to B||c-axis. An off axis superconducting phase diagram is proposed.",This article has been withdrawn. The observed mutual inductance change coincided with the lower transition which should have been interpreted as the upper critical field. The conclusions of the article were subject to the questionable assumption that a dissipative part of the mutual inductance signal (not measured) could be present.,12

----
In this paper we show the somewhat surprising result that in two or more dimensions the classical Sobolev inequality persists for exponents $p<1$. This sharpens the known inequalities for the Riesz potentials mapping the real Hardy spaces, demonstrating that while these spaces are an appropriate replacement for $L^p$ to guarantee the boundedness of a wide class of singular integral (zeroth order) operators for $p<1$, the presence of fractional integration allows for the possibility of an improvement.

My thanks to a researcher who contacted me concerning the estimate and for ongoing discussions that brought the issue to light.  Interestingly the result is related to a paper and a technical report of Jaak Peetre made aware to me by Mario Milman, Michael Cwikel, and Gunnar Spaar after posting this article.  Peetre obtains for Besov spaces B^{s,p}, $p<1$ a similar embedding in one dimension, while the lower bound of where he claims such a result is possible is precisely what I obtain in this article.  So I still believe the result to be true, but it needs another proof!  My apologies for any inconvenience to possibly interested readers.  Please contact me if you are interested in further discussion though!","This paper has been withdrawn due to a dependency error - in the proof there is an epsilon chosen to depend on $x$, the choice of which occurs after some manipulation of Riesz potentials that amounts to integration by parts in $x$.

2302.09620v2,2302.09620v1,Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI),Jointly Complementary&Competitive Influence Maximization with Concurrent Ally-Boosting and Rival-Preventing,"In this paper, we propose a new influence spread model, namely, Complementary\&Competitive Independent Cascade (C$^2$IC) model. C$^2$IC model generalizes three well known influence model, i.e., influence boosting (IB) model, campaign oblivious (CO)IC model and the IC-N (IC model with negative opinions) model. This is the first model that considers both complementary and competitive influence spread comprehensively under multi-agent environment. Correspondingly, we propose the Complementary\&Competitive influence maximization (C$^2$IM) problem. Given an ally seed set and a rival seed set, the C$^2$IM problem aims to select a set of assistant nodes that can boost the ally spread and prevent the rival spread concurrently. We show the problem is NP-hard and can generalize the influence boosting problem and the influence blocking problem. With classifying the different cascade priorities into 4 cases by the monotonicity and submodularity (M\&S) holding conditions, we design 4 algorithms respectively, with theoretical approximation bounds provided. We conduct extensive experiments on real social networks and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.

The upper boundary is in contact with the atmosphere, and the lower boundary is a rigid flat bottom. We prove the global well-posedness of the inviscid and resistive problem with surface tension around a non-horizontal uniform magnetic field; moreover, the solution decays to the equilibrium almost exponentially.

However, our understanding about the explicit convergence rates of the parameter estimates, and their dependence on the learning (like denoising and dropout rate) and structural (like depth and layer lengths) aspects of the network is less mature. An interesting question in this context is to ask if the network structure could ""guide"" the choices of such learning parameters. In this work, we explore these gaps between network structure, the learning mechanisms and their interaction with parameter convergence rates. We present a way to address these issues based on the backpropagation convergence rates for general nonconvex objectives using first-order information. We then incorporate two learning mechanisms into this general framework -- denoising autoencoder and dropout, and subsequently derive the convergence rates of deep networks. Building upon these bounds, we provide insights into the choices of learning parameters and network sizes that achieve certain levels of convergence accuracy.

1503.05487v2,1503.05487v1,Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn),Premixed Flame Dynamics in Narrow 2D Channels,"Premixed flames propagating within small channels show complex combustion phenomena that differ from flame propagation at conventional scales. Available experimental and numerical studies have documented stationary/non-stationary and/or asymmetric modes that depend on properties of the incoming reactant flow as well as channel geometry and wall temperatures. The present work seeks to illuminate mechanisms leading to symmetry-breaking and limit cycle behavior that are fundamental to these combustion modes. Specifically, four cases of lean premixed methane/air combustion -- two equivalence ratios (0.53 and 0.7) and two channel widths (2 and 5mm) -- are investigated in a 2D configuration with constant channel length and bulk inlet velocity, where numerical simulations are performed using detailed chemistry. External wall heating is simulated by imposing a linear temperature gradient as a boundary condition on both walls. In the 2mm-channel, both equivalence ratios produce flames that stabilize with symmetric flame fronts after propagating upstream. In the 5mm-channel, flame fronts start symmetric, although symmetry is broken almost immediately after ignition. Further, 5mm channels produce instationary combustion modes with dramatically different limit cycles: : in the leaner case ({\phi} = 0.53), the asymmetric flame front flops periodically, whereas in the richer case ({\phi} = 0.7), flames with repetitive extinctions and ignitions (FREI) are observed. In order to provide insights into mechanisms responsible for flame dynamics, reaction fronts and flame fronts are captured and differentiated. Results show that the loss of flame front symmetry originates in a region where negative stretch rates close to the flame cusp show large gradients/curvatures; thus, symmetry-breaking is attributed to a hydrodynamic instability. Limit cycle behavior is [...]","This paper has been withdrawn by authors, because there is a mistake in stretch rate calculation (in Equation 5, instead of u_n, the displacement speed should be used) that should be resolved",15

The paper consists of three parts. The first part focuses on the construction of an $L_1$ consistent estimator of $f$. In particular, under the assumptions that the probability measure $\mu$ of the observation is atomic, and the map from $f$ to $\mu$ is bijective, it is shown that there exists an estimator $f_n$ such that for every density $f$ $\lim_{n\to \infty} \mathbb{E} \left[ \int |f_n -f | \right]=0$. The second part discusses the implementation details. Specifically, it is shown that the consistency for every $f$ can be attained with a computationally feasible estimator. The third part, as a study case, considers a Poisson mixture model. In particular, it is shown that in the Poisson noise setting, the bijection condition holds and, hence, estimation can be performed consistently for every $f$.",Reason for withdrawal: There is an issue with the proof of Theorem 1,6

With interconnections among multiple LAPPNs, power dispatching can be further extended to intra- and inter-LAPPN power interchanges. It becomes a significant issue to schedule the two kinds of power interchanges as, from a system perspective high utilization of available scheduling time slots and low overall transmission loss should be guaranteed, and from a subscriber perspective a high scheduled ratio of transmission requests with a fair transmission sequence in terms of transmission urgency are expected. To this end, we propose a cooperative power dispatching framework for connected LAPPNs, including subscriber matching and two-layer power transmission scheduling. The former matches subscribers from different LAPPNs, considering both subscriber preferences and power transmission loss. The latter coordinates the intra- and inter-LAPPN power packet transmission to maximize the amount of energy delivered with a guaranteed fairness on user urgency. Simulation results of a two-LAPPN system are provided, which demonstrate that the proposed framework can achieve effective and efficient power dispatching in terms of the mentioned concerns, and reveal facts on ideal system capacity and how to manipulate the proportions of the two kinds of transmissions according to network status.",The author decides to withdraw the current version due to statistical mistakes in the simulation section,9

We show that holonomy in the McVittie spacetime, which represents a gravitating object imbedded in an expanding universe, can in principle be used to measure the expansion of the universe, for example by measuring changes in the components of a gyroscopic spin axis. Although such changes are of course small, they are large enough ($\D S \sim 10^{-7}$) that they could conceivably be measured if the real universe behaved like the McVittie spacetime. The real problem in is that virialization will lead to domains decoupled from the global expansion on a scale much larger than that of the solar system, making such an experiment infeasible probably even in principle. Nevertheless the effect is of interest in relation to ongoing discussions, dating back at least to Einstein and Straus, which concern the relationship between the expansion of the universe and local systems.","The paper contains an error that we are attempting to address.

The TTN is used to extend the texture samples of a clean image and helps classifiers focus on its shape. GAN is utilized to form a training framework for the model and generate the necessary images.

To match the requirements for those applications in terms of tolerance to non-ionizing radiation, it is being tried to deplete the sensitive volume of the, traditionally non-depleted, silicon sensors. We study the feasibility of this approach for the common case that the collection diodes of the pixel are small as compared to the pixel pitch. An analytic equation predicting the thickness of the depletion depth and the capacity of this point-like junction is introduced. We find that the predictions of this equations differs qualitatively from the usual results for flat PN junctions and that $dC/dU$-measurements are not suited to measure the depletion depth of diodes with point-like geometry. The predictions of the equation is compared with measurements on the depletion depth of CMOS sensors, which were carried out with a novel measurement protocol. It is found that the equation and the measurement results match with each other. By comparing our findings with TCAD simulations, we find that precise simulation models matches the empirical findings while simplified models overestimate the depletion depth dramatically.

We additionally find small spin period changes as a function of orbital phase of ~0.02 seconds translating to velocities of ~ a few km/s. The obtained orbital-folded velocity profile displays two clear maxima and minima, and cannot be explained by the radial velocity of the orbiting white dwarf. Instead we propose that the observed velocities are the sum of the radial velocities of both the white dwarf and of the stellar surface facing the white dwarf which reprocesses the WD spin pulses. This combination can explain the observed low velocities in FO Aqr. However asymmetries in the orbital configuration are required to explain the double peaked velocity profile. One possible scenario would invoke binary eccentricity. We thus developed a simple binary model to explain and fit our observations, and find a small binary eccentricity of e=0.03. Although small, persistent eccentricity in a close interacting binary would induce enhanced mass transfer occurring preferentially at periastron passages. We thus discuss alternative scenarios where other asymmetries might explain our observations assuming circular orbits. Since FO Aqr is the first system where the combined radial velocities of both the WD and secondary surface have been measured, it is possible that other mass-transferring binaries also display similar velocity curves when observed with Kepler. These will provide additional valuable tests to either confirm or rule out small eccentricities in similar systems.","This paper has been withdrawn by the authors due to a crucial error in the data analysis resulting in misinterpretation of the results.

While most of existing results focus on the performance of all jobs (both successfully completed and canceled), in this work we explore scheduling policies that improve the sojourn time of successful jobs, which are typically more valuable to the user. Our model assumes that each job has a known discrete size distribution (e.g., estimated from previous execution logs) where the largest size value indicates a successful completion, while other size values correspond to termination checkpoints. In the single-server case where all jobs are available for scheduling simultaneously, we prove that optimal schedules do not preempt jobs, even when preemption overhead is negligible. Based on this, we develop a scheduling policy that minimizes the sojourn time of successful jobs asymptotically, i.e., when the number of jobs grows to infinity. Through an extensive numerical study, we show that this policy performs better than existing alternatives even when the number of jobs is finite. For more realistic scenarios with multiple servers and dynamic jobs arrivals, we propose an online approach based on our single-server scheduling policy.

While theoretically important, there is a lack of practical applications for this task. This paper presents a way to turn any boson sampling device for which there are certain fabrication limits into a physically unclonable function which could be used in identification systems and other security protocols. For a minimum fabrication error, there are scenarios for which the photon distribution at the output of two different devices has a minimum distance and they can be told apart. When compared to classical PUFs these linear optical tokens have the advantage that, for the right choice of parameters, there is a computational guarantee that no classical computer can simulate the output. The paper describes the basic limitations of boson sampling which allow these results and gives a possible choice for a challenge-response identification protocol. This gives a direct application of boson sampling which could be simpler than solving the general problem.","The paper has two flaws that make the scheme useless. As noted by many correspondents, two samples from the same device cannot be directly compared. There are exponentially many sampled values and the comparison is inefficient. This could be solved with some binning methods mapping many samples to one bin, but then the distance to the distributions of imperfect clones is not clear. The second problem is that there are efficient ways to produce samples classically which cannot be told apart from the correct ones with a reasonable number of steps",10

However, complicated data augmentations and time-consuming graph convolutional operation undermine the efficiency of these methods. To solve this problem, we propose a Simple Contrastive Graph Clustering (SCGC) algorithm to improve the existing methods from the perspectives of network architecture, data augmentation, and objective function. As to the architecture, our network includes two main parts, i.e., pre-processing and network backbone. A simple low-pass denoising operation conducts neighbor information aggregation as an independent pre-processing, and only two multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) are included as the backbone. For data augmentation, instead of introducing complex operations over graphs, we construct two augmented views of the same vertex by designing parameter un-shared siamese encoders and corrupting the node embeddings directly. Finally, as to the objective function, to further improve the clustering performance, a novel cross-view structural consistency objective function is designed to enhance the discriminative capability of the learned network. Extensive experimental results on seven benchmark datasets validate our proposed algorithm's effectiveness and superiority. Significantly, our algorithm outperforms the recent contrastive deep clustering competitors with at least seven times speedup on average.",There is an error in the introduction of the loss-pass denoiseing operation.

2308.01097v4,2308.01097v3,Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV),Spatio-Temporal Branching for Motion Prediction using Motion Increments,"Human motion prediction (HMP) has emerged as a popular research topic due to its diverse applications, but it remains a challenging task due to the stochastic and aperiodic nature of future poses. Traditional methods rely on hand-crafted features and machine learning techniques, which often struggle to model the complex dynamics of human motion. Recent deep learning-based methods have achieved success by learning spatio-temporal representations of motion, but these models often overlook the reliability of motion data. Additionally, the temporal and spatial dependencies of skeleton nodes are distinct. The temporal relationship captures motion information over time, while the spatial relationship describes body structure and the relationships between different nodes. In this paper, we propose a novel spatio-temporal branching network using incremental information for HMP, which decouples the learning of temporal-domain and spatial-domain features, extracts more motion information, and achieves complementary cross-domain knowledge learning through knowledge distillation. Our approach effectively reduces noise interference and provides more expressive information for characterizing motion by separately extracting temporal and spatial features. We evaluate our approach on standard HMP benchmarks and outperform state-of-the-art methods in terms of prediction accuracy.","The incremental information of our paper includes the displacement information from the last frame of the historical sequence, derived from the motion information of the first frame in the future sequence and the motion information of the last frame of the historical sequence.

Zero potential is concomitant with an initial condition for $\varphi$ that is exponentially more probable than an initial condition that assumes an initial inflaton potential of order of the Planck mass. The Einstein gravitational field equations are formulated on an eight-dimensional spacetime manifold of four space dimensions and four time dimensions. The field equations are sourced by a cosmological constant $\Lambda$ and the real massless scalar inflaton field $\varphi$. Two solution classes for the coupled Einstein field equations are obtained that exhibit temporal exponential \textbf{deflation of three of the four time dimensions} and temporal exponential inflation of three of the four space dimensions. For brevity this phenomenon is sometimes simply called ""inflation"". We show that \textbf{the extra time dimensions do not generally induce exponentially rapid growth of fluctuations of the fields.} Comoving coordinates for the two \textbf{unscaled} dimensions are chosen to be $(x^4, x^8)$ (unscaled means a constant scale factor equal to one). The $x^4$ coordinate corresponds to our universe's observed physical time dimension, while the $x^8$ coordinate corresponds to a new spatial dimension that may be compact. $\partial_{x^8}$ terms of $\varphi$ and the metric are seen to play the role of an effective inflaton potential in the dynamical field equations.

Still, its interpretation is unclear since its original derivation is flawed. We use an intuitive physical framework to derive the Drude-Smith formula for systems where microscopically free charges are accumulated on a mesoscopic scale by localized scatterers. Within this framework, the model allows us to quantify the microscopic momentum relaxation time of the charges and the fraction of mesoscopically localized charges in addition to the direct current limit of the conductivity. We show that the Drude-Smith model is unique among different Drude-Lorentz models because the relaxation time of the free carriers also determines the frequency and damping of the resonance of the bound charges.","The assumptions made in eq.

The quasi-orthogonality of Galerkin solutions is a key argument in modern proofs of optimal convergence of adaptive mesh refinement algorithms. Our generalization together with other well understood properties of the error estimator still implies linear convergence of the estimator and hence rate optimal convergence. This approach drastically simplifies a recent proof of optimality of the adaptive algorithm for the stationary Stokes problem and generalizes it to $d\geq 2$ and provides a proof of optimality for non-symmetric FEM-BEM coupling.

We argue this difference in boundary conditions only matters when they are imposed at a radius $r=\epsilon < Z \alpha/m$ where $m$ is the orbiting-particle mass, because only then is the particle relativistic at these distances. The boundary condition difference is therefore important for ordinary Hydrogen while not for muonic Hydrogen. The boundary condition can be interpreted in terms of a second type of nuclear moment, and a prediction is made for the proton-radius energy shift as a function of charge-radius, $r_p$, this second nuclear moment, $h$, and orbiting particle mass, $m$.

Unlike general object detection, logo detection is a challenging task, especially for small logo objects and large aspect ratio logo objects in the real-world scenario. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, named Discriminative Semantic Feature Pyramid Network with Guided Anchoring (DSFP-GA), which can address these challenges via aggregating the semantic information and generating different aspect ratio anchor boxes. More specifically, our approach mainly consists of Discriminative Semantic Feature Pyramid (DSFP) and Guided Anchoring (GA). Considering that low-level feature maps that are used to detect small logo objects lack semantic information, we propose the DSFP, which can enrich more discriminative semantic features of low-level feature maps and can achieve better performance on small logo objects. Furthermore, preset anchor boxes are less efficient for detecting large aspect ratio logo objects. We therefore integrate the GA into our method to generate large aspect ratio anchor boxes to mitigate this issue. Extensive experimental results on four benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed DSFP-GA. Moreover, we further conduct visual analysis and ablation studies to illustrate the advantage of our method in detecting small and large aspect logo objects.

In this paper, we adopt the Bloch transform and the perturbation theory to investigate a special case, i.e., when the rough surface is a slight perturbation of a periodic one. Based on known results from the Bloch transform, the problem could be written into an equivalent bounded variational problem in higher dimensional spaces. The first step is to consider the non-perturbed problem. From the perturbation theory, the solution could be written as a Neumann series. The second step is to consider the slightly perturbed problems. The key point in the process is the relationship between the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map. With the study between these two operators, it is proved that when the right hand side belongs to a certain space, the problem is equivalent to a modified one.

Several estimators have been proposed  for this problem, including Indyk's median estimator \cite{indy:focs00}, Li's geometric means estimator \cite{pinglib:2006}, an \Hss-based estimator \cite{gc:random07}. The first two estimators require space $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$, where the $\tilde{O}$ notation hides polylogarithmic factors in $\epsilon^{-1}, m, n$ and $M$. Recently, Kane, Nelson and Woodruff in \cite{knw:soda10} present a space-optimal and novel estimator, called the log-cosine estimator.
In this paper, we present an elementary analysis of the  log-cosine estimator in a stand-alone setting. The  analysis in \cite{knw:soda10} is more complicated.",Withdrawn due to an error in proof of Lemma 2.2,7

Note that the minus sign is important since the corresponding term in the Euler-Lagrange functional is concave. Contrary to the convex case there are no solutions for the Dirichlet problem, due to the power being $-1$. We therefore study the Neumann problem and prove a local existence result for solutions bifurcating from constant solutions. In the radial case we show that one of the two bifurcation branches is global and unbounded, and we find its asympotic behaviour.","There is a significant problem in the proof of Theorem 2.1: the ""classical bifurcation result for potential operators"" quoted at the end of the proof of 2.1 seems not to be so well known and the cited paper [8] only covers a very partial case .

1805.10628v2,1805.10628v1,Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV),A Simple Riemannian Manifold Network for Image Set Classification,"In the domain of image-set based classification, a considerable advance has been made by representing original image sets as covariance matrices which typical lie in a Riemannian manifold. Specifically, it is a Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) manifold. Traditional manifold learning methods inevitably have the property of high computational complexity or weak performance of the feature representation. In order to overcome these limitations, we propose a very simple Riemannian manifold network for image set classification. Inspired by deep learning architectures, we design a fully connected layer to generate more novel, more powerful SPD matrices. However we exploit the rectifying layer to prevent the input SPD matrices from being singular. We also introduce a non-linear learning of the proposed network with an innovative objective function. Furthermore we devise a pooling layer to further reduce the redundancy of the input SPD matrices, and the log-map layer to project the SPD manifold to the Euclidean space. For learning the connection weights between the input layer and the fully connected layer, we use Two-directional two-dimensional Principal Component Analysis ((2D)2PCA) algorithm. The proposed Riemannian manifold network (RieMNet) avoids complex computing and can be built and trained extremely easy and efficient. We have also developed a deep version of RieMNet, named as DRieMNet. The proposed RieMNet and DRieMNet are evaluated on three tasks: video-based face recognition, set-based object categorization, and set-based cell identification. Extensive experimental results show the superiority of our method over the state-of-the-art.","There are some errors in the submitted paper.

However, most of the recent deep learning based methods neglect the semantic structure of fine-grained objects, and do not take advantages of the traditional fine-grained recognition techniques (e.g. coarse-to-fine classification). In this paper, we propose a novel framework, i.e., semantic bilinear pooling, for fine-grained recognition with hierarchical multi-label learning. This framework can adaptively learn the semantic information from the hierarchical labels. Specifically, a generalized softmax loss is designed for the training of the proposed framework, in order to fully exploit the semantic priors via considering the relevance between adjacent levels. A variety of experiments on several public datasets show that our proposed method has very impressive performance with low feature dimensions compared to other state-of-the-art methods.","There were some errors. In Fig.3, the loss of coarse branch should be traditional softmax. In Table 2, the max iterations should be 100000 and 40000.

2303.15863v2,2303.15863v1,Theoretical Economics (econ.TH),Study on the risk-informed heuristic of decision-making on the restoration of defaulted corporation networks,"Government-run (Government-led) restoration has become a common and effective approach to the mitigation of financial risks triggered by corporation credit defaults. However, in practice, it is often challenging to come up with the optimal plan of those restorations, due to the massive search space associated with defaulted corporation networks (DCNs), as well as the dynamic and looped interdependence among the recovery of those individual corporations. To address such a challenge, this paper proposes an array of viable heuristics of the decision-making that drives those restoration campaigns. To examine their applicability and measure their performance, those heuristics have been applied to two real-work DCNs that consists of 100 listed Chinese A-share companies, whose restoration has been modelled based on the 2021 financial data, in the wake of randomly generated default scenarios. The corresponding simulation outcome of the case-study shows that the restoration of the DCNs would be significantly influenced by the different heuristics adopted, and in particular, the system-oriented heuristic is revealed to be significantly outperforming those individual corporation-oriented ones. Therefore, such a research has further highlighted that the interdependence-induced risk propagation shall be accounted for by the decision-makers, whereby a prompt and effective restoration campaign of DCNs could be shaped.","An effective influencing factor that has not been taken into account is the importance of each node in the overall topology, which will lead to biased research results and mislead the reader.

The coefficient of this linear contribution is largest along the nested regions but remains finite elsewhere, and is strongly dependent on the impurity scattering rate $\delta$.

In particular, we design a randomized algorithm that maintains with high probability: 1) $st$-Reachability in $\tilde{O}(mn^{4/5})$ total update time. 2) $st$-Reachability in a total update time of $\tilde{O}(n^{8/3})$ in a dense graph. 3) SSR in a total update time of $\tilde{O}(m n^{9/10})$. 4) SCC in a total update time of $\tilde{O}(m n^{9/10})$. For all the above problems, we improve upon the previous best algorithm (by Henzinger et. al. (STOC 2014)). Our main focus is maintaining $st$-Reachability in an edge decremental directed graph (other problems can be reduced to $st$-Reachability). The classical algorithm of Even and Shiloach (JACM 81) solved this problem in $O(1)$ query time and $O(mn)$ total update time. Recently, Henzinger, Krinninger and Nanongkai (STOC 2014) designed a randomized algorithm which achieves an update time of $\tilde{O}(m n^{0.98})$ and broke the long-standing $O(mn)$ bound of Even and Shiloach. However, they designed four algorithms $A_i (1\le i \le 4)$ such that for graphs having total number of edges between $m_i$ and $m_{i+1}$ ($m_{i+1} > m_i$), $A_i$ outperforms other three algorithms. That is, one of the four algorithms may be faster for a particular density range of edges, but it may be too slow asymptotically for the other ranges. Our main contribution is that we design a {\it single} algorithm which works for all types of graphs. Not only is our algorithm faster, it is much simpler than the algorithm designed by Henzinger this http URL .

In this work, we identify the proper definition of Berry phase of nonlinear bulk modes and characterize topological phases in one-dimensional (1D) generalized nonlinear Schr_dinger equations in fully nonlinear regime, where the nonlinear parts of interactions are comparable to the linear ones. Without utilizing linear analysis, we develop an analytic strategy to demonstrate the quantization of Berry phase due to reflection symmetry. Interestingly, the lattice encounters a topological phase transition controlled by nonlinear bulk mode amplitudes. We then show nonlinear extension of bulk-edge correspondence by identifying topological boundary modes. We propose three classical structures that can be experimentally implemented.

However, it is open whether they can be solved in polynomial time, making them unamenable for practical usage. To overcome this restriction, we consider 3-color parity games, which can be solved in polynomial time. They still cover an expressive fragment of specifications, as they include the classical B_chi and co-B_chi winning conditions as well as their union and intersection. This already suffices to express many useful combinations of safety and liveness properties, as for example the family of GR(1). 
The best known algorithm for 3-color parity games solves a game with n vertices in $ O(n^{2}\sqrt{n}) $ time. We improve on this result by presenting a new algorithm, based on simple attractor constructions, which only needs time $ O(n^2) $. As a result, we match the best known running times for solving (co)-B_chi games, showing that 3-color parity games are not harder to solve in general.","This paper has been withdrawn by the author due to a crucial error in Lemma 1.7, which additionally needs the assumption that V' is a trap for Player 1-i.

By solving the auxiliary problem with consistent mean field approximations, a set of decentralized strategies is designed, and its asymptotic social optimality is further proved. Next, the results are applied into the study of opinion dynamics in social networks. The evolution of opinions is analyzed over finite and infinite horizons, respectively.

Different from the traditional Chebyshev transfer function filters, the return loss zeros of the proposed non-equiripple filters can be redistributed within the operating passband. For the industrial applications, the proposed filters have a reduced sensitivity to manufacturing errors and exhibit good tolerance control for both specified bandwidth and maximum in-band reflection loss. By deriving the transfer functions, a synthesis approach with a set of non-linear equations can be established according to the specifications such as the bandwidth and predetermined reflection lobes. Without performing any post optimization in the full-wave simulation, the non-equiripple synthesized results have less sensitivity and fractional bandwidth (delta) error in comparison with those obtained from traditional Chebyshev transfer functions with equiripple frequency responses.

Each user will ask for one of the files in the library, which needs to be delivered by the server through the intermediate communication network. The objective is to design the cache placement (without prior knowledge of users' future requests) and the delivery phase in order to minimize the (normalized) delivery delay. We assume that the delivery phase consists of two steps: (1) generation of a set of multicast messages at the server, one for each subset of users, and (2) delivery of the multicast messages to the users. In this setting, we show that there exists a universal scheme for cache placement and multicast message generation, which is independent of the underlying communication network between the server and the users, and achieves the optimal delivery delay to within a constant factor for all memoryless networks. We prove this result, even though the capacity region of the underlying communication network is not known, even approximately.

Target detection, image segmentation, and image recognition outcomes are all directly impacted by the impact of image enhancement. However, the majority of the currently used image enhancement techniques do not produce satisfactory outcomes, and these enhanced networks have relatively weak robustness. We suggest an improved network called BrightenNet that uses U-Net as its primary structure and incorporates a number of different attention mechanisms as a solution to this issue. In a specific application, we employ the network as the generator and LSGAN as the training framework to achieve better enhancement results. We demonstrate the validity of the proposed network BrightenNet in the experiments that follow in this paper.

Although some EAs have been proposed and extensively studies, the No Free Lunch (NFL) theorems indicate that no EA will be suited to all optimization problems. Therefore, to provide new effective EA alternatives is always of great significant to deal with a huge number of optimization problems. In this study, a new EA named multi-agent across-neighbourhood search (MAS) is proposed for numerical optimization. Instead of the inspiration from natural phenomena, MAS is motivated by two straightforward assumptions and three important issues raised in improving and designing efficient EAs. In MAS, a group of agents collaboratively search in the solution space for the optimal solution of the optimization problem considered. A collection of superior solutions found by agents so far is maintained and updated dynamically. At each generation, an agent directly searches across the neighbourhoods of multiple superior solutions with the guidance of a Gaussian distribution. This search manner is referred to as across-neighbourhood search. The characteristics of MAS are discussed and the uniqueness of MAS compared with other EAs is identified. The principle behind MAS is simple. Moreover, MAS is fairly easy for the implementation and application with only three parameters being required to tune (Matlab codes are available from the author). Extensive experiments on 22 benchmark optimization functions of different types demonstrate that MAS has well balanced exploration and exploitation capabilities and performs better than many efficient traditional EAs and newly emerged EAs.",This paper has been withdrawn by the author due to a crucial errors in equation 3 and the simulation,26

We also suppose that the harvested energy of MUs are used for their uplink information transmission. We devise a radio resource allocation (RRA) algorithm to maximize the uplink sum data rate of MUs subject to a minimum required downlink data rate of each MU and maximum allowable transmit power of each BS, AP, and MU. More specifically, both the frequency division duplex (FDD) and time division duplex (TDD) schemes are investigated. The proposed non-convex optimization problems are solved using an iterative algorithm. It is also proved that the proposed algorithm converges to a near-optimal solution. Simulation results illustrate that the TDD scheme improves the performance compared to the FDD scheme.

If the information disseminated is accurate, for example, maximizing its distribution is desirable, whereas if it is a rumor or a virus, its spread should be minimized. In this context, it is very important to identify super-spreaders that maximize or minimize propagation. Lately, studies for detecting super-spreaders have gained momentum. Most of the studies carried out aim to distinguish the influences of nodes under a specific propagation model (such as SIR) using network centrality measures and subsequently, to rank the nodes accordingly. However, in this study, we developed an algorithm that approximates the expected influence of nodes under the popular SIR model. By considering the behavior of the SIR model and only the shortest paths between nodes, the algorithm ranks the nodes according to this approximated value. Our developed algorithm was named the Expected Value Estimation (EVE).

We show that this vector field restricts to $Hilb_k(\mathbf{P}^2)$, the Hilbert scheme of $k$ points in the projective plane. After observing that $Hilb_k(\mathbf{P}^2)$ cannot be a regular $SL(2)$-variety, we show that it is a principal subvariety in the grassmannian.

Subsequently we prove that each closed interval of $\mathcal{C}_{\gamma}$ is trim, we determine its breadth, and we characterize the closed intervals that are dismantlable.","This paper has been withdrawn by the author due to a gap in the proof of Theorem 1.1(i). The results in Theorems 1.1(ii)-(iv) and 1.2, and those needed for their proofs remain true, and will be addressed in separate articles. I suspect that the claim of Theorem 1.1(i) is still true. In fact, I suspect that quotients of HH-lattices are HH-lattices again. Comments are very welcome",24
1803.02105v4,1803.02105v3,Applied Physics (physics.app-ph),Nonlinear Photoelasticity to Explicate Acoustic Dephasing Dynamics,"Detection and controlling of acoustic (AC) phonon phase have been strenuous tasks although such capability is crucial for further manipulating thermal properties. Here, we present a versatile formalism for tracing AC nanowaves with arbitrary strain compositions by incorporating the nonlinear photoelasticity (PE) into ultrafast acoustics where broad AC spectrum encompassing thermally important THz frequency range should be collected far beyond Brillouin frequency. The initial AC phase upon displacive carrier generation could be inherently varied depending on the bipolar AC compositions by implementing externally biased piezoelectric diodes. The importance of adopting nonlinear PE is then manifested from the transient phase shift either abrupt at the point of diffuse surface scattering or gradual during phonon-phonon or phonon-electron scattering events based on which the ratio of nonlinear to linear PE coefficient is experimentally extracted as a function of the detection probe energy, reaching 0.98 slightly below the bandgap. As the probing energy is rather set away from the bandgap, AC phase is completely invariant with any scattering events, exhibiting the conventional trend at Brillouin frequency in linear regime. Under potent influence of nonlinear PE, the AC dephasing time during the propagation are quantified as a function of AC wavepacket size and further correlated with intrinsic and extrinsic AC scattering mechanisms in electron reservoir.","In the second paragraph of page 2, the dependence of AC phonon propagation direction was omitted in the mathematical formula of differential reflectivity spectra which is the basis for deriving equations 2 and 3. Therefore, there were errors in phase and amplitude values of figures 3 and 4, analyzed based on equations 2 and 3",7

2402.10307v2,2402.10307v1,Information Theory (cs.IT),A New Radio to Overcome Critical Link Budgets,"We propose Multi-Antenna (MA) Towards Inband Shift Keying (TISK): a new multi-carrier radio concept to cope with critical link budgets. In contrast to common proposals that rely on analog beamforming at both transmitter and receiver, MA-TISK does not require beam alignment. The transmitted signals have all constant envelope in continuous time, which allows for efficient, low-cost power amplification and up-conversion. The concept is compatible with any linear PSK-modulation as well as pulse position modulation. Each sub-carrier is sent over a separate antenna that is equipped with a voltage-controlled oscillator. The phases of these oscillators are controlled by digital baseband. Temporal signal combining makes up for the lack of beamforming gain at the transmitter. A common message may be broadcast to many receivers, simultaneously. Demodulation can be efficiently implemented by means of fast Fourier transform. MA-TISK does not suffer from spectral re-growth issues plaguing other constant envelope modulations like GMSK. Almost rectangular signal spectra similar to those for linear modulation with root-raised-cosine pulse shaping are possible. For the 100 MHz-wide spectral mask of 5G downlink, QPSK-modulation allows for 160 MBit/s with 5.74 MHz subcarrier spacing when using 16 transmit antennas. The wide carrier spacing makes the signals insensitive to Doppler effects. There is no loss in link budget gain compared to spatial beamforming at the transmitter.","The paper is not correct.

For $\rho=1,$ we prove the sharpness of this order for the weak (1,1) inequality for elliptic Fourier integral operators. For real phase functions, for such operators the local boundedness from $H^1$ to $L^1$ was proved by Seeger, Sogge and Stein in [14], and the local weak (1,1) inequality for $\rho=1$ was proved by Tao [16]. Here we give an alternative simpler proof of Tao's result in the spirit of the Seeger, Sogge and Stein proof, employing the atomic decomposition of $L^1$ due to Abu-Shammala and Torchinsky. In fact, our method also allows to extend such local weak (1,1) results to the case of complex phase functions and to different rank conditions for the canonical relation.","Unfortunately, we have found a mistake in the proof of Theorem 1.1, that is the main theorem of this work.

Here we unveil by first-principles calculations a new, highly anisotropic ripple pattern in phosphorene, a monolayer black phosphorus, where compression induced ripple deformation occurs only along the zigzag direction, but not the armchair direction. This direction-selective ripple deformation mode in phosphorene stems from its puckered structure with coupled hinge-like bonding configurations. Strain energy is released by a bond-angle distortion mode along the armchair direction, while a steep energy rise associated with a bond-compression mode along the zigzag direction necessitates ripple deformation as the dominant mechanism for strain energy release. This unique ripple pattern leads to anisotropic electronic properties with a robust energy band gap under the ripple deformation along the zigzag direction, but a sharp gap reduction under the strain along the armchair direction. The present results offer new insights into the mechanisms governing the structural and electronic properties of phosphorene crucial to its device applications.","It has been withdrawn by the authors due to a crucial expression error in Figure 4, and several references mis-cited",15

In our model, the risk free short rate follows a generalized Hull-White model. The default event occurs in an expected or unexpected manner when the firm value reaches a certain lower threshold - the default barrier at predetermined discrete announcing dates or at the first jump time of a Poisson process with given default intensity, respectively. Then our pricing problem is derived to a solving problem of PDE with constant default intensity and terminal value of binary type in every subinterval between the two adjacent announcing dates.

1911.02980v2,1911.02980v1,Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn),Modal stability analysis of viscoelastic channel and pipe flows using a well-conditioned spectral method,"Modal stability analysis provides information about the long-time growth or decay of small-amplitude perturbations around a steady-state solution of a dynamical system. In fluid flows, exponentially growing perturbations can initiate departure from laminar flow and trigger transition to turbulence. Although flow of a Newtonian fluid through a pipe is linearly stable for very large values of the Reynolds number ($Re \sim 10^7$), a transition to turbulence often occurs for $Re$ as low as $1500$. When a dilute polymer solution is used in the place of a Newtonian fluid, the transitional value of the Reynolds number decreases even further. Using the spectral collocation method and Oldroyd-B constitutive equation, Garg et al. (Phys. Rev. Lett. 121:024502, 2018) claimed that such a transition in viscoelastic fluids is related to linear instability. Since differential matrices in the collocation method become ill-conditioned when a large number of basis functions is used, we revisit this problem using the well-conditioned spectral integration method. We show modal stability of viscoelastic pipe flow for a broad range of fluid elasticities and polymer concentrations, including cases considered by Garg et al. Similarly, we find that plane Poiseuille flow is linearly stable for cases where Garg et al. report instability. In both channel and pipe flows, we establish the existence of spurious modes that diverge slowly with finer discretization and demonstrate that these can be mistaken for grid-independent modes if the discretization is not fine enough.","We are withdrawing the manuscript because the boundary conditions on stress fluctuations used in the pipe-flow calculations may be too restrictive, causing unstable modes to be missed",27

Is it possible to actually make Harry's invisibility cloaks? The most promising approach for realizing such magical cloaking in our real world would be to use transformation optics, where an empty space with a distorted geometry is imitated with a non-distorted space but filled with transformation medium having appropriate permittivity and permeability. An important requirement for practical invisibility cloaks is nonreciprocity; that is, a person in the cloak should not be seen from the outside but should be able to see the outside. This invisibility cloak, or a nonreciprocal shield, cannot be created as far as we stay in conventional transformation optics. Conventional transformation optics is based on Riemann geometry with a metric tensor independent of direction, and therefore cannot be used to design the nonreciprocal shield. To overcome this problem, we propose an improved theory of transformation optics that is based on Finsler geometry, an extended version of Riemann geometry. Our theory shows that nonreciprocal shielding can be realized by covering cloaking space with transformation medium having anisotropic, nonreciprocal permittivity and permeability. This theory includes conventional Pendry's and Leonhardt's theories as special cases. We show the method for designing the spatial distribution of the permittivity and permeability required to make the nonreciprocal shield.","This paper has been withdrawn by the author due to crucial errors in equations 5, 8 and 18",10

2108.11088v2,2108.11088v1,Systems and Control (eess.SY),Robust AC Transmission Expansion Plans from A Novel Dual Based Bi-level Approach,"The rapid integration of Renewable Energy Sources (RESs) strengthens the need for a power network that can robustly handle the system's uncertain scenarios. Thus, this paper proposes the first nonlinear novel dual based bi-level approach for robust AC Transmission Expansion Planning (TEP) plans with uncertainties in RES generations and loads. It utilizes a convex relaxation and is solved by Benders Decomposition (BD), where the master determines the robust AC TEP plan. The novel dual slave model for the second level of BD circumvents the issues in using the conventional conic dual theory and aids in the worst-case realization of uncertainties using additional novel constraints. The novel dual slave is solved using Interior Point Method (IPM), as it is not a mixed-integer problem. The proposed work also includes additional linear constraints to reduce the BD's slow convergence and direct the master towards optimality. The robustness of the AC TEP plans is verified by Monte-Carlo Simulation (MCS) of the actual nonlinear and non-convex AC Optimal Power Flow (OPF). The effect of the budget of uncertainty on the AC TEP plans is also investigated. A comparison with the results of a previous work reveals the superiority of the proposed work.","There is a major error in the signs and notations of variables in (46) - (58).

Her recent book, Statistical Inference as Severe Testing, is a comprehensive exposition of her arguments in the context of a historical study of many threads of statistical inference, both frequentist and Bayesian. Her foundational point of view is called error statistics, emphasizing frequentist evaluation of the errors called Type I and Type II in the Neyman-Pearson theory of frequentist hypothesis testing. Since the field of elementary particle physics (also known as high energy physics) has strong traditions in frequentist inference, one might expect that something like the severity concept was independently developed in the field. Indeed, I find that, at least operationally (numerically), we high-energy physicists have long interpreted data in ways that map directly onto severity. Whether or not we subscribe to Mayo's philosophical interpretations of severity is a more complicated story that I do not address here.","My implementation of the connection between severity and p-CL was incorrect, as explained to me by [REDACTED-NAME]",25

The coding gain achieved by the proposed gray code order over the existing lexicographic order is also analyzed and verified via simulations, which reveals a maximum of about 1.2dB for the case of four transmit antennas. Based on the gray coding framework, we further propose a diversity-enhancing scheme named intersected gray (I-gray) code order for DSM, where the permutations of active antenna indices are selected directly from the odd (even) positions of the full permutations in the gray code order. From analysis and simulations, it is shown that the I-gray code order can harvests an additional diversity order at the expense of only one information bit loss for each transmission with respect to the gray code order.",This paper has been withdrawn by the author due to a crucial error in equation 2,5

To achieve a sound trade-off between the segmentation performance and the speed of clustering, we come up with a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence-based FCM algorithm by incorporating a tight wavelet frame transform and a morphological reconstruction operation. To enhance FCM's robustness, an observed image is first filtered by using the morphological reconstruction. A tight wavelet frame system is employed to decompose the observed and filtered images so as to form their feature sets. Considering these feature sets as data of clustering, an modified FCM algorithm is proposed, which introduces a KL divergence term in the partition matrix into its objective function. The KL divergence term aims to make membership degrees of each image pixel closer to those of its neighbors, which brings that the membership partition becomes more suitable and the parameter setting of FCM becomes simplified. On the basis of the obtained partition matrix and prototypes, the segmented feature set is reconstructed by minimizing the inverse process of the modified objective function. To modify abnormal features produced in the reconstruction process, each reconstructed feature is reassigned to the closest prototype. As a result, the segmentation accuracy of KL divergence-based FCM is further improved. What's more, the segmented image is reconstructed by using a tight wavelet frame reconstruction operation. Finally, supporting experiments coping with synthetic, medical and color images are reported. Experimental results exhibit that the proposed algorithm works well and comes with better segmentation performance than other comparative algorithms. Moreover, the proposed algorithm requires less time than most of the FCM-related algorithms.",This paper has been withdrawn by the author due to a crucial definition error of objective function,13

Our spanner has almost optimal size and is at most a $\log n$ factor away from the upper bound on the worst-case size.

Different from the previous studies, here we turn to consider the large-scale clustering information of observed DM of FRB catalog, which only needs the rough redshift distribution, instead of the exact redshift information of each FRB. Firstly, we consider the instantaneous ""\texttt{tanh}"" model for $x_e(z)$ and find that including the auto-correlation information of the mock catalog, about $10^4$ FRBs with the intrinsic DM scatter of 100 $\rm pc/cm^3$ spanning 20\% of all sky, could significantly improve the constraint on the width $\Delta_z$ of the model, when comparing with that from the CMB data alone. The evolution shape of the ionization fraction will be tightly narrowed, namely the duration of the epoch of reionization has been shrunk, $z_{\rm dur}<1.15$ (68\% C.L.). Furthermore, we also use another redshift-asymmetric reionization model and obtain that the FRB mock catalog could measure the ionization fraction at $z=6$ precisely with the $1\sigma$ error $\Delta x_e(z=6)=0.009$, which means that the large-scale clustering information of observed DM of FRB catalog is very sensitive to the ionization fraction of the end of reionization epoch.

In our approach, the starvation at the bottleneck caused by service time randomness is modeled and captured by interruptions. Fundamental properties of tandem queues with finite buffer capacity are examined. We show that in general system service rate of a dual tandem queue with finite buffer capacity is equal or smaller than its bottleneck service rate, and virtual interruptions, which are the extra idle period at the bottleneck caused by the non-bottlenecks, depend on arrival rates. Hence, system service rate is a function of arrival rate when the buffer capacity of a tandem queue is finite.

But the number of excitations determine also the gap energy which further determines the energy of the condensate and the energy spectrum of quasiparticles. Such extra contributions to the total energy of the system--which are not taken into account in the standard formalism--led us to a redefinition of the quasiparticle energies and of the quasiparticle populations by the usual method of the maximization of the superconductor partition function. The result of this correction is a critical temperature which is lower than the BCS critical temperature and a finite jump of the energy gap at the phase transition. The discontinuity of the energy gap at the critical temperature marks a first order phase transition which is also in disagreement with the standard BCS interpretation. The fact that the standard BCS formalism is theoretically inconsistent is revealed in the calculation of the heat capacity and of the internal energy.

Secondly, we propose linear and non-linear fusion strategies to aggregate initial ranking lists of multimodal face pairs and acquire the optimized re-ranked list based on modal complementarity.

In this paper, we propose the RElative COre MErge (RECOME) clustering algorithm. The core of RECOME is a novel density measure, i.e., Relative $K$ nearest Neighbor Kernel Density (RNKD). RECOME identifies core objects with unit RNKD, and partitions non-core objects into atom clusters by successively following higher-density neighbor relations toward core objects. Core objects and their corresponding atom clusters are then merged through $\alpha$-reachable paths on a KNN graph. Furthermore, we discover that the number of clusters computed by RECOME is a step function of the $\alpha$ parameter with jump discontinuity on a small collection of values. A jump discontinuity discovery (JDD) method is proposed using a variant of the Dijkstra's algorithm. RECOME is evaluated on three synthetic datasets and six real datasets. Experimental results indicate that RECOME is able to discover clusters with different shapes, density and scales. It achieves better clustering results than established density-based clustering methods on real datasets.

As an application, we consider the empirical measure of position and jumps of a continuous-time process on aunbounded domain of $R^d$. This model is inspired by the adaptation of a population to a changing environment. Jumps makes it possible for the process to face a deterministic dynamics leading to high extinction areas.","The argument in the proof of Proposition 1.3.4 is wrong and I cannot give simple conditions ensuring that the function is strictly increasing.

Specifically, the extreme learning machine (ELM) is introduced to train a set of data distributed across several components, and each component runs a program on a subset of the entire data. In this scheme, there is no requirement for a fusion center in the network due to e.g., practical limitations, security, or privacy reasons. We first reformulate the centralized ELM training problem into a separable form among nodes with consensus constraints. Then, we solve the equivalent problem using distributed optimization tools. A new distributed cooperative learning algorithm based on ELM, called DC-ELM, is proposed. The architecture of this algorithm differs from that of some existing parallel/distributed ELMs based on MapReduce or cloud computing. We also present an online version of the proposed algorithm that can learn data sequentially in a one-by-one or chunk-by-chunk mode. The novel algorithm is well suited for potential applications such as artificial intelligence, computational biology, finance, wireless sensor networks, and so on, involving datasets that are often extremely large, high-dimensional and located on distributed data sources.

As per the ""practical Dirac-Majorana confusion theorem"" it is impossible to distinguish between Dirac and Majorana neutrinos via any kinematic tests when their masses are very small. However, it is also well known that Majorana neutrino and anti-neutrino present in the final state must obey the Fermi-Dirac statistics, irrespective of how small the mass of neutrino is. We propose a new method to search for Majorana neutrinos by exploiting their quantum statistical property. We analyse `effective' three-body decays of the kind $X \to Y \nu \overline{\nu}$ (e.g.\ $X \left[ B^0 \right] \to \pi^+ \big( \to \mu^+ \nu_{\mu} \big) \mu^- \overline{\nu}_{\mu} \equiv Y \left[ \mu^+ \mu^-\right] \nu_{\mu} \overline{\nu}_{\mu}$), with 4-momenta of $X$ and $Y$ experimentally known, such that the 4-momenta of both neutrino and anti-neutrino can be deduced. For Majorana neutrinos the distribution of events in the `effective' Dalitz plot for such a well chosen process would be fully symmetric under exchange of the neutrino and anti-neutrino. Unlike the neutrinoless double-beta decay or other lepton-number violating modes, this distinction between Majorana and Dirac neutrinos survives even in the almost massless neutrino limit due to the quantum statistical property.","Since the methodology suggested in Section II is not appropriate for checking the quantum statistical property of neutrinos, this paper is being withdrawn",12

Both SN types have a similar temporal evolution, suggesting broadly similar progenitors. However, while some Ic SNe are associated with relativistic jets of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), no GRB has yet been found in association with Type Ib SNe. Here we find that, even if GRB-like central engines operate in both SNe Ib and Ic, different properties of their envelopes may accommodate this potential tension. In particular, we focus on the case of a low-mass, extended envelope surrounding the progenitor star (as produced, for example, by strong mass losses prior to explosion). If the envelopes of Type Ib SNe are sufficiently massive ($M_{\rm ext}\sim(0.3-1)M_\odot$) and extended ($R_{\rm ext}\sim 10^{13}\text{ cm}$), we show that (i) GRB-like jets cannot break out of the star; (ii) the SN light curve is compatible with current observations. Different envelope properties of Type Ib SNe with respect to (at least some) Type Ic SNe may be connected to the presence of a helium layer surrounding the star.","We realised that eq. 4 and 5 are not appropriate if a large amount of energy is deposited directly into the envelope.

This paper studies a branch of EBMs, i.e., energy-based Generative ConvNets (GCNs), which minimize their energy function defined by a bottom-up ConvNet. From the perspective of particle physics, we solve the problem of unstable energy dissipation that might damage the quality of the synthesized samples during the maximum likelihood learning. Specifically, we firstly establish a connection between classical FRAME model [1] and dynamic physics process and generalize the GCN in discrete flow with a certain metric measure from particle perspective. To address KL-vanishing issue, we then reformulate GCN from the KL discrete flow with KL divergence measure to a Jordan-Kinderleher-Otto (JKO) discrete flow with Wasserastein distance metric and derive a Wasserastein GCN (wGCN). Based on these theoretical studies on GCN, we finally derive a Generalized GCN (GGCN) to further improve the model generalization and learning capability. GGCN introduces a hidden space mapping strategy by employing a normal distribution for the reference distribution to address the learning bias issue. Due to MCMC sampling in GCNs, it still suffers from a serious time-consuming issue when sampling steps increase; thus a trainable non-linear upsampling function and an amortized learning are proposed to improve the learning efficiency. Our proposed GGCN is trained in a symmetrical learning manner. Our method surpass the existing models in both model stability and the quality of generated samples on several widely-used face and natural image datasets.","after the submission we found there is fatal error in this paper.

We propose a method to resolve the single-photon emitters with only detecting the highest order correlation functions. We find that the variables that characterize the emitters are contained in the highest order correlation functions. Especially when there are more than two emitters, the spatial distribution of the emitters can be deduced only from the highest order correlation functions, which gives a new vision and a new method on beating classical diffraction limit using high order correlation functions.","The theory in this paper is wrong, I didn't take the propagation phase of photons into consideration",6

The problem of high utility itemset mining has specifically garnered huge research focus in the past decade, as it aims to find the patterns from the databases that conform to an objective utility function. Several algorithms exist in literature to mine the high utility items from the databases; however, most of them require large execution time and have high memory consumption. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm, R-Miner, based on a novel data structure, called the residue maps, that stores the utility information of an item directly and is used for the mining process. Several experiments are undertaken to assess the efficacy of the proposed algorithm against the benchmark algorithms. The experimental results indicate that the R-Miner algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art mining algorithms.","Since teh R-Miner algorithm extracts patterns based on the minimum utility threshold, it is susceptible to missing out on extracting some patterns when the user defined threshold value is high.

An important problem has been that standard migration theories predict very rapid inward migration, which poses problems for population synthesis models. However, it has been shown recently that low-mass planets (20-30 Earth Masses) that are still embedded in the protoplanetary disc can migrate outwards under certain conditions. Simulations have been performed mostly for planets at given radii for a particular disc model. Here, we plan to extend previous work and consider different masses of the disc to quantify the influence of the physical disc conditions on planetary migration. We perform three-dimensional (3D) radiation hydrodynamical simulations of embedded planets in protoplanteary discs. For planets on circular orbits at various locations we measure the radial dependece of the torques. For all considered planet masses (20-30 Earth masses) in this study we find outward migration within a limited radial range of the disc, typically from about 0.5 up to 1.5-2.5 a_Jup. Inside and outside this intervall, migration is inward and given by the Lindblad value for large radii. Because outward migration stops at a certain location in the disc, there exists a zero-torque distance for planetary embryos, where they can continue to grow without moving too fast. For higher disc masses (M_disc > 0.02 M_Sol) convection ensues, which changes the structure of the disc and therefore the torque on the planet as well. Outward migration stops at different points in the disc for different planetary masses, resulting in a quite extended region where the formation of larger cores might be easier. In higher mass discs, convection changes the disc's structure resulting in fluctuations in the surface density, which influence the torque acting on the planet, and therefore its migration rate.",Error in the torque formula comparison.

1707.05179v2,1707.05179v1,Combinatorics (math.CO),"Weak Modular Product of Bipartite Graphs, Bicliques and Isomorphism","A 1978 theorem of Kozen states that two graphs on $n$ vertices are isomorphic if and only if there is a clique of size $n$ in the weak modular product between the two graphs. Restricting to bipartite graphs and considering complete bipartite subgraphs (bicliques) therein, we study the combinatorics of the weak modular product. We identify cases where isomorphism is tractable using this approach, which we call Isomorphism via Biclique Enumeration (IvBE). We find that IvBE is polynomial for bipartite $2K_2$-free graphs and quasi-polynomial for families of bipartite graphs, where the largest induced matching and largest induced crown graph grows slowly in $n$, that is, $O(\mathrm{polylog }\, n)$. Furthermore, as expected a straightforward corollary of Kozen's theorem and Lov_sz's sandwich theorem is if the weak modular product between two graphs is perfect, then checking if the graphs are isomorphic is polynomial in $n$. However, we show that for balanced, bipartite graphs this is only true in a few trivial cases. In doing so we define a new graph product on bipartite graphs, the very weak modular product. The results pertaining to bicliques in bipartite graphs proved here may be of independent interest.","Algorithm 1 (IvBE) is irreparably flawed. Moreover, Theorem 2, concerning perfection of weak modular products of balanced, bipartite graphs is incorrect. Thank you to an anonymous reviewer for pointing out these flaws in the paper.

Moreover, we show that the resolutions of the symplectic $4$-orbifolds $X/G$ and $\tilde{X}/G$ are in the same symplectic birational equivalence class; in fact, the resolution of $\tilde{X}/G$ can be reduced to that of $X/G$ by successively blowing down symplectic $(-1)$-spheres. To any finite symplectic $G$-action on a $4$-manifold $M$, we associate a pair $(M_G,D)$, where $\pi: M_G\rightarrow M/G$ is the canonical resolution of the quotient orbifold and $D$ is the pre-image of the singular set of $M/G$ under $\pi$. We propose to study the $G$-action on $M$ by analyzing the smooth and symplectic topology of $M_G$ as well as the embedding of $D$ in $M_G$. In particular, the following conjectured inequality between the symplectic Kodaira dimensions of $M$ and $M_G$, $$ \kappa^s(M_G)\leq \kappa^s(M), $$ will play a central role in this new approach. For an illustration, we consider the case where $M$ is a symplectic Calabi-Yau surface. In particular, it is shown that in this case, $M_G$ is either minimal with $\kappa^s(M_G)=0$, or a rational surface, or a ruled surface over an elliptic curve, confirming the above conjecture.

For the low-frequency driving, the qubit population at equilibrium is a periodical function of time, owing to the contribution of the nonresonant terms. In order to obtain the average population, it is found that the average approximation based on the perturbation approach can be applied to the low-frequency region. For the extremely low frequency which is much smaller than the decoherence rate, we develop noncoherence approximation by dividing the evolution into discrete time steps during which the coherence is lost totally. These approximations present comprehensive analytical descriptions of LZS interference in most of parameter space of frequency and decoherence rate, agreeing well with those of the numerical simulations and providing a simple but integrated understanding to system dynamics.

In our credit risk model, the risk free short rate is a constant and the default event occurs in an expected manner when the firm value reaches a given default barrier at predetermined discrete announcing dates or in an unexpected manner at the first jump time of a Poisson process with given default intensity given by a step function of time variable, respectively. We consider both endogenous and exogenous default recovery. Our pricing problem is derived to a solving problem of inhomogeneous or homogeneous Black-Scholes PDEs with different coefficients and terminal value of binary type in every subinterval between the two adjacent announcing dates. In order to deal with the difference of coefficients in subintervals we use a relation between prices of higher order binaries with different coefficients. In our model, due to the inhomogenous term related to endogenous recovery, our pricing formulae are represented by not only the prices of higher binary options but also the integrals of them. So we consider a special binary option called intergral of i-th binary or nothing and then we obtain the pricing formulae of our defaultable corporate bond by using the pricing formulae of higher binary options and integrals of them.","This paper has been withdrawn by the authors due to crucial errors in the formulae (3.7) and (3.8) and the proofs. 1305.6988v1 with another title ""[REDACTED-NAME] with [REDACTED-NAME] Recovery and Integral of [REDACTED-NAME] Options"" is including errors, too",17

Co-clustering is more advantageous over traditional one dimensional clustering in many ways such as, ability to find highly correlated sub-groups of rows and columns. However, one of the overlooked benefits of co-clustering is that, it can be used to extract meaningful knowledge for various other knowledge extraction purposes. For example, building predictive models with high dimensional data and heterogeneous population is a non-trivial task. Co-clusters extracted from such data, which shows similar pattern in both the dimension, can be used for a more accurate predictive model building. Several applications such as finding patient-disease cohorts in health care analysis, finding user-genre groups in recommendation systems and community detection problems can benefit from co-clustering technique that utilizes the predictive power of the data to generate co-clusters for improved data analysis. In this paper, we present the novel idea of Predictive Overlapping Co-Clustering (POCC) as an optimization problem for a more effective and improved predictive analysis.

The inventory control costs, incurred only when interventions of the inventory state are placed, have both a fixed and a variable component.

In our setting, we obtain analytical results that are of significant implications. Specifically, we establish the existence of the optimal control, and we provide the solution in closed-form.

Separately, nonlocality is a property shared by some bipartite quantum systems, indicating a correlation of the component parts that cannot be described by local classical variables. In this work, we show that breaking the positive-semidefinite requirement and allowing states with a negative minimal eigenvalue arbitrarily close to zero, allows for the construction of states that are nonlocal under one component labelling but local when the labelling is interchanged. This is an observer-dependent nonlocality, showing the connection between nonlocal objectivism and negative quasi-probabilities.","An error in the calculation of the eigenvalues for \beta^{T}\beta for the right-identity case (Sec. 3, eq. 8 line 1).

For such data, a binary regression model incorporating misclassification probabilities is extensively used by researchers in different application contexts. The model, however, suffers from a serious estimation problem because of confounding of the unknown misclassification probabilities with the regression parameters. To overcome this problem, in addition to the main sample, use of internal validation data is proposed. However, the maximum likelihood estimators (MLE) are found to be substantially biased. Investigating further, we propose a maximum pseudo-likelihood method of estimation which leads to bias reduction. For drawing inference on the regression parameters, we develop a rigorous asymptotic theory for the maximum pseudo-likelihood estimators under standard assumptions. To facilitate its easy implementation, a bootstrapped version of the estimator is proposed, and its distributional consistency is proved. Extensions of these results are also provided for more general misclassification models. The results of the simulation studies are encouraging. The methodology is illustrated with a survey data.",The numerical results on the full likelihood estimators in Section 3 are not correct. The paper will be modified suitably,47

Coming up with good coverage models implies more energy efficient networks. $K$-coverage is one model that ensures that every point in a given 3D Field of Interest (FoI) is guaranteed to be covered by $k$ sensors. When it comes to 3D, coming up with a deployment of sensors that gurantees $k$-coverage becomes much more complicated than in 2D. The basic idea is to come up with a geometrical shape that is guaranteed to be $k$-covered by taking a specific arrangement of sensors, and then fill the FoI will non-overlapping copies of this shape. In this work, we propose a new shape for the 3D scenario which we call a \textbf{Devilsoid}. Prior to this work, the shape which was proposed for coverage in 3D was the so called \textbf{Reuleaux Tetrahedron}. Our construction is motivated from a construction that can be applied to the 2D version of the problem \cite{MS} in which it imples better guarantees over the \textbf{Reuleaux Triangle}. Our contribution in this paper is twofold, firstly we show how Devilsoid gurantees more coverage volume over Reuleaux Tetrahedron, secondly we show how Devilsoid also guarantees simpler and more pragmatic deployment strategy for 3D wireless sensor networks.

Second, we devise a perturbation series on the cutoff scale and propose an explicit solution of the renormalization problem, by treating the interaction part alone.

The Sliding Token problem asks if one could transform $I$ to $J$ via a sequence of elementary steps, where each step requires sliding a token from one vertex to one of its neighbors so that the resulting set of vertices where tokens are placed remains independent. This problem is $\mathsf{PSPACE}$-complete even for planar graphs of maximum degree $3$ and bounded-treewidth. In this paper, we show that Sliding Token can be solved efficiently for cactus graphs and block graphs, and give upper bounds on the length of a transformation sequence between any two independent sets of these graph classes. Our algorithms are designed based on two main observations. First, all structures that forbid the existence of a sequence of token slidings between $I$ and $J$, if exist, can be found in polynomial time. A sufficient condition for determining no-instances can be easily derived using this characterization. Second, without such forbidden structures, a sequence of token slidings between $I$ and $J$ does exist. In this case, one can indeed transform $I$ to $J$ (and vice versa) using a polynomial number of token-slides.","The algorithm for block graphs in this manuscript contains some flaws.

An improved prioritized experience replay is employed to better take advantage of the different knowledge learned by different agents which utilizes Time-difference (TD) error more effectively.

We consider the problem in the interactive bandit-feedback setting where we don't know the dynamics of the IIEG. In general, only the interactive trajectory and the reached terminal node value $v(z^t)$ are revealed. To learn NE, the regret minimizer is required to estimate the full-feedback loss gradient $\ell^t$ by $v(z^t)$ and minimize the regret. In this paper, we propose a generalized framework for this learning setting. It presents a theoretical framework for the design and the modular analysis of the bandit regret minimization methods. We demonstrate that the most recent bandit regret minimization methods can be analyzed as a particular case of our framework. Following this framework, we describe a novel method SIX-OMD to learn approximate NE. It is model-free and extremely improves the best existing convergence rate from the order of $O(\sqrt{X B/T}+\sqrt{Y C/T})$ to $O(\sqrt{ M_{\mathcal{X}}/T} +\sqrt{ M_{\mathcal{Y}}/T})$.

Such functions can be plugged into the trace formula to study certain sums of automorphic $L$-functions.

This can be witnessed in recent works studying the predictive power of social media data and in the transformation of business practices around data. It is not clear, however, how to go from expected-value predictions based on predictive observations to decisions that yield high profits and carry low risk. As classical problems of portfolio allocation and inventory management show, decisions based on mean-field analysis are suboptimal and high in risk. In this paper we endeavor to refit existing machine learning predictive methodology and theory to the purpose of prescribing optimal decisions based directly on data and predictive observations. We study the convergence as more data becomes available of such methods to the omniscient optimal decision, that which exploits these predictive observations to their fullest extent by using the unknown distribution of parameters. Incredibly, the data-driven prescriptions developed converge to the omniscient optimum for almost all realizations of data and for almost any given predictive observation and even when data is not IID, which is generally the case in practice.

2008.06295v2,2008.06295v1,Programming Languages (cs.PL),Proving Almost-Sure Termination of Probabilistic Programs via Incremental Pruning,"The extension of classical imperative programs with real-valued random variables and random branching gives rise to probabilistic programs. The termination problem is one of the most fundamental liveness properties for such programs. The qualitative (aka almost-sure) termination problem asks whether a given program terminates with probability 1. Ranking functions provide a sound and complete approach for termination of non-probabilistic programs, and their extension to probabilistic programs is achieved via ranking supermartingales (RSMs). RSMs have been extended to lexicographic RSMs to handle programs with involved control-flow structure, as well as for compositional approach. There are two key limitations of the existing RSM-based approaches: First, the lexicographic RSM-based approach requires a strong nonnegativity assumption, which need not always be satisfied. The second key limitation of the existing RSM-based algorithmic approaches is that they rely on pre-computed invariants. The main drawback of relying on pre-computed invariants is the insufficiency-inefficiency trade-off: weak invariants might be insufficient for RSMs to prove termination, while using strong invariants leads to inefficiency in computing them. Our contributions are twofold: First, we show how to relax the strong nonnegativity condition and still provide soundness guarantee for almost-sure termination. Second, we present an incremental approach where the process of computing lexicographic RSMs proceeds by iterative pruning of parts of the program that were already shown to be terminating, in cooperation with a safety prover. In particular, our technique does not rely on strong pre-computed invariants. We present experimental results to show the applicability of our approach to examples of probabilistic programs from the literature.",We discovered that the proof of Theorem 5.7 is incorrect and hence we need to withdraw the paper.

The longstanding Willmore Conjecture that the Clifford torus minimizes $W$ among genus-$1$ surfaces is now a theorem of Marques and Neves [19], but the general conjecture [10] that Lawson's [16] minimal surface $\xi_{g,1}\subset\mathbb S^3$ minimizes $W$ among surfaces of genus $g>1$ remains open. Here we prove this conjecture under the additional assumption that the competitor surfaces $M\subset\mathbb S^3$ share the ambient symmetries of $\xi_{g,1}$. Specifcally, we show each Lawson surface $\xi_{m,k}$ satisfies the analogous $W$-minimizing property under a somewhat smaller symmetry group ${G}_{m,k}<SO(4)$, using a local computation of the orbifold Euler number $\chi_o(M/{G}_{m,k})$ to exclude certain intersection patterns of $M$ with the great circles fixed by generators of ${G}_{m,k}$.

However, multiphoton pulses can also generate secure keys if we can confirm that there is no attack. In this paper, under the null hypothesis of no PNS attack, we first determine whether there is an attack or not by retrieving the missing information of the existing decoy-state protocols, extract a Cauchy distribution statistic, and further provide a detection method and the Type I error probability. If the result is judged to be an attack, we can use the existing decoy-state method and the GLLP formula to estimate secure key rate. Otherwise, all pulses received including both single-photon pulses and multiphoton pulses, can be used to generate the keys and we give the secure key rate in this case. Finally, the associated experiments we performed (i.e., the significance level is $5\%$) show the correctness of our method.","In the partial PNS attack, Eve can make the over gain of signal state and decoy state equal to those in normal case and does not increase error rate.

One of the direct consequences of the third law is that the specific heat of any system converges to zero when its temperature decreases to zero Kelvins. Here we show that the third law is violated in a wide class of fermionic systems, by calculating the specific heat and showing that it diverges to infinity when the absolute zero temperature is approached.

In any sliding window of $T+1$ time slots, we assume no more than $N_1$ and $N_2$ erasures are introduced by the first-hop channel and second-hop channel respectively. Under this channel loss assumption, we fully characterize the maximum achievable rate in terms of $T$, $N_1$ and $N_2$. The achievability is proved by using a symbol-wise decode-forward strategy where the source symbols within the same message are decoded by the relay with different delays. The converse is proved by analyzing the maximum achievable rate for each channel when the erasures in the other channel are consecutive (bursty).

In this article, a simple sufficient condition for a \emph{finitely generated} lattice to not be embeddable in a free lattice is derived, which is easier to verify than checking if Jonsson's condition, L = D(L) = D^d(L), holds. It provides a systematic way of providing counterexamples to the false claim that: ""all finitely generated semidistributive lattices satisfying Whitman's condition is a sublattice of a free lattice."" To the best of the author's knowledge, this result is new. A corollary that is derived from this is a non-trivial property of free lattices which might not yet be known in the literature. Moreover, a problem concerning finitely generated semidistributive lattices will be posed.","I found an error in the main result of this article by finding a counterexample, the lattices being produced may not satisfy Whitman's condition. Beyond this, the procedure appears to work well. I found the counterexample by considering the relatively free lattice FL(2 + 2) (the lattice FL(2 + 2) can be found in the literature, for instance, Gratzer's text: [REDACTED-NAME] Theory, 2nd Ed)",7

Recently, single-photon sources developed in the field of quantum optics have enabled direct tests of single-photon vision that were not possible with classical light sources. Using a heralded source based on spontaneous parametric downconversion to generate single photons which were sent to an observer at either an early or late time, Tinsley and Molodtsov et al. (2016) had observers judge when the photon was seen. Based on the above-chance accuracy in both a subset of high-confidence trials and in all post-selected trials, they claimed to show that humans can see single photons. However, we argue that this work suffers from three major issues: self-contradicting results, inappropriate statistical analyses, and a critical lack of statistical power. As a result, we cannot conclude that humans can see single photons based on the data of this study. We present a careful examination of the statistical analyses and the internal consistency of the data, which indicated that none of the key evidence holds.","Referees noted that due to uncertainty in the parameters used to derive our estimate of the maximum accuracy, this analysis is not sufficient to challenge the basic conclusions of Tinsley et al.

We study the Birkhoff-Rott equation, which describes the motion of vortex sheets according to the incompressible Euler equations in two dimensions. The classical Kelvin-Helmholtz instability demonstrates that an infinite, flat vortex sheet has a strong linear instability. We show that this is not the case for circular vortex sheets: such a configuration has a delicate linear stability, and is the first example of a linearly stable solution to the Birkhoff-Rott equation. We subsequently derive a sufficient condition for linear instability of a circular vortex sheet for a family of generalized Birkhoff-Rott kernels, and prove that a common regularized kernel used in numerical simulation and analysis destabilizes the circular vortex sheet. Absent a destabilizing kernel regularization, our work suggests that the nonlinear dynamics are critical for understanding circular vortex sheet instability, and so the essential mechanism of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability is dependent on global vortex sheet geometry. As expected, nonlinear numerical simulations utilizing the regularized kernel exhibit unstable behavior. Finally, we show experimental results which qualitatively match the types of instabilities that are observed numerically, demonstrating the persistence of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in real circular shear flows.","Regretfully, we have found a mistake that renders the main result (Theorem 2.2) incorrect.

We prove an upper-bound on the Lipschitz constant of the larger block in terms of the Lipschitz constants of the smaller blocks.

Often, prediction is performed after estimated spatial covariance parameters are plugged into the prediction equation. The estimated spatial association parameters arealso plugged into the prediction variance of the spatial predictor. However, simply plugging in spatial covariance parameter estimates into the prediction variance of the spatial predictor does not take into account the uncertainty in the true values of the spatial covariance parameters. Therefore the plug-in prediction variance estimate will underestimate the true prediction variance of the estimated spatial predictor, especially for small datasets. We propose a new way to estimate the prediction variance of the estimated spatial predictor based on a covariance penalty using parametric bootstrapping. Our new estimator is compared to three other prediction variance estimators proposed in literature. The new prediction variance estimator generally performs better than the plug in method for small datasets with weak spatial association, although sometimes it is second best among the four prediction variance estimators compared.

To this day, no constructions exist based on standard assumptions. In this study, we propose an alternative notion called quantum cheques (QCs) that is more attainable and technologically feasible. A quantum cheque can be verified using a public-key but only by a single user. Specifically, the payer signs the quantum cheque for a particular recipient using their ID, and the recipient can validate it without the assistance of the bank, ensuring that the payer cannot assign the same cheque to another user with a different ID. Unlike quantum money, QCs only necessitate quantum communication when a cheque is issued by the bank, meaning all payments and deposits are entirely classical! We demonstrate how to construct QCs based on the well-studied learning-with-errors (LWE) assumption. In the process, we build two novel primitives which are of independent interest. Firstly, we construct signatures with publicly-verifiable deletion under LWE. This primitive enables the signing of a message $m$ such that the recipient can produce a classical string that publicly proves the inability to reproduce a signature of $m$. We then demonstrate how this primitive can be used to construct 2-message signature tokens. This primitive enables the production of a token that can be used to sign a single bit and then self-destructs. Finally, we show that 2-message signature tokens can be used to construct QCs.","Construction 1 is insecure which is the building block for the rest of the paper.

A possible formation of a quasicrystal at a different value of the density,"In this note, we report about two, as it seems to us, rather unusual observations made in molecular dynamics simulations of the single component systems of particles interacting through the harmonic-repulsive pair potential in 3D. In particular, at some densities, we observed deeply supercooled liquid states which did not exhibit crystallization in rather long MD runs. This observation is unusual because usually liquids formed by particles of only one type rather readily crystallize on supercooling. At a different value of the density we observed crystallization of the liquid into a state formed by chains (or lines) of particles which organize themselves into columns in such a way that each column is formed by seven lines of particles. Alternatively, one can think that each such column is formed by three alternating helical coils. In our view, it is possible that the overall structure that crystallizes from the liquid at this density is quasicrystalline. If it is indeed the case, then this observation is unusual because, as far as we understand, it is not expected, at present, that quasicrystalline structures can form in such a simple potential as harmonic-repulsive potential. Investigations related to the presumable phase diagram of the particles interacting through the harmonic-repulsive potential have been reported in [J. Chem. Phys. {\bf 134}, 044903 (2011)].

If $p\geq p_s$, the problem does not admit any positive solution with $\nu$ being a Dirac mass. If $p\in(1,p_s)$ there exits a threshold value $\rho^*>0$ such that for $\rho\in (0, \rho^*]$, the problem admits a positive solution and for $\rho>\rho^*$, no positive solution exists.

We analyze the convergence properties for both convex and nonconvex problems by modeling the training process as a dynamic system, and provide a guideline to select the observation distance without grid search. A data-dependent regret bound is proposed to guarantee the convergence in the convex setting.

For such code sequences, it is shown that their effect, in terms of mutual information, on the additional bounded variance signal, is as if additional additive Gaussian noise has been transmitted. Moreover, the analysis shows that for reliable communication the bounded variance signal must be completely estimated by the receiver (i.e., the minimum mean-square error tends to zero).

An ideal decolorization algorithm should preserve the original color contrast as much as possible. Meanwhile, it should provide the final decolorized result as fast as possible. However, most of the current methods are suffering from either unsatisfied color information preservation or high computational cost, limiting their application value. In this paper, a simple but effective technique is proposed for real-time decolorization. Based on the typical rgb2gray() color conversion model, which produces a grayscale image by linearly combining R, G, and B channels, we propose a dominant color hypothesis and a corresponding distance measurement metric to evaluate the quality of grayscale conversion.

We reduce the shifted convolution problem for $L$-function coefficients of $\operatorname{GL}_n({\bf{A}}_F)$-automorphic forms to the better-understood setting of $\operatorname{GL}_2({\bf{A}}_F)$. The key idea behind this reduction is to use the classical projection operator $\mathbb P^n_1 \varphi$ together with properties of its Fourier-Whittaker expansion. This allows us to derive novel integral presentations for the shifted convolution problem as Fourier-Whittaker coefficients of certain $L^2$-automorphic forms on the mirabolic subgroup $P_2({\bf{A}}_F)$ of $\operatorname{GL}_2({\bf{A}}_F)$ or its two-fold metaplectic cover $\overline{P}_2({\bf{A}}_F)$. We then construct liftings of these mirabolic forms to $\operatorname{GL}_2({\bf{A}}_F)$ and its two-fold metaplectic cover $\overline{G}({\bf{A}}_F)$ to justify expanding the underlying forms into linear combinations of Poincar_ series. Decomposing each of the Poincar_ series spectrally then allows us to derive completely new bounds for the shifted convolution problem in dimensions $n \geq 3$. As an application, we derive a uniform subconvexity bound for $\operatorname{GL}_n({\bf{A}}_F)$-automorphic $L$-functions twisted by Hecke characters.

The two possible Lagrange multipliers are a chemical potential, which fixes the mean neutrino/anti-neutrino asymmetry, and a Majorana mass, which fixes the mean spin-entropy. Because these neutrinos originated from a thermal bath, their entropy should be maximal, implying that each state in the background is a symmetric superposition of a neutrino and anti-neutrino. Therefore the Standard Model must be augmented by a flavor-diagonal Majorana neutrino mass matrix. This impacts the propagator via tadpole diagrams due to self-interactions. In the low-energy limit, neutrino self-interactions are entirely off-diagonal because same-flavor four-fermion operators vanish by Pauli exclusion. These interactions must be diagonalized when propagating through a bath of neutrinos, using the U(3) global flavor symmetry. U(3) gets broken broken down to SO(3) by Majorana masses, and down to $A_4$ if the three masses are different. Thus our universe today contains tri-bimaximal mixing and Majorana neutrinos. Neutrino mixing is due to the mismatch between the flavor-diagonal Majorana mass matrix arising at finite density and the self-interaction diagonal finite density propagator. The mass hierarchy is inverted and Majorana phases are absent. Lepton number is conserved and the neutrino-less double beta decay experiment absorbs a pair of neutrinos from the relic background and will prove their Majorana nature.",Withdrawn because of an error in Eq.13 (prediction of neutrino mixings),5

We prove that the selection problem of the dominant dataset is an NP-complete problem.

Furthermore, the scanning selection algorithm with the time complexity O(n2) and the greedy selection algorithm with the time complexity O(n3) are respectively proposed to extract the dominant dataset based on the linear correlation between time-series data.

Then, preservation of regularity allows to prove that the global flow exists for all smoother data. This mechanism cannot be applied in the non deterministic setting, such as the global well-posedness on the statistical ensemble of an invariant (Gibbs) measure, first obtained by Bourgain. We present a new and general technique to prove that data smoother than those in the statistical ensemble give rise to global flows, despite the fact that the measures carried by such smoother data are no longer invariant.

Surprisingly, rotation does not cause any charge redistribution, i.e. in the two-dimensional electron gas centrifugal forces are quantum mechanically suppressed.","The predicted orbital effect is equal to the Ampere magnetic moment of the rotating conduction electron density, which is canceled by the positive background charge",11
2202.06460v2,2202.06460v1,Machine Learning (cs.LG),Simultaneous Transport Evolution for Minimax Equilibria on Measures,"Min-max optimization problems arise in several key machine learning setups, including adversarial learning and generative modeling. In their general form, in absence of convexity/concavity assumptions, finding pure equilibria of the underlying two-player zero-sum game is computationally hard [Daskalakis et al., 2021]. In this work we focus instead in finding mixed equilibria, and consider the associated lifted problem in the space of probability measures. By adding entropic regularization, our main result establishes global convergence towards the global equilibrium by using simultaneous gradient ascent-descent with respect to the Wasserstein metric -- a dynamics that admits efficient particle discretization in high-dimensions, as opposed to entropic mirror descent. We complement this positive result with a related entropy-regularized loss which is not bilinear but still convex-concave in the Wasserstein geometry, and for which simultaneous dynamics do not converge yet timescale separation does. Taken together, these results showcase the benign geometry of bilinear games in the space of measures, enabling particle dynamics with global qualitative convergence guarantees.","Error in the proof of Lemma 1, which makes Theorem 1 not hold",36

In this study, the first principle calculation was performed to investigate on the size effect on the electronic, mechanic and piezoelectric properties of hexagonal-BN nanotube (BNNT). It demonstrates that the nanotube diameter can modulate the direct bandgap significantly of the zigzag-BNNT, increasing from 3.96eV to 4.44eV with the larger diameter from 10 to 16 unit cells in circular direction. Both armchair and zigzag BNNT exhibit large elastic modulus, implying promising applications in nanoscale surface engineering, tribology and nanomanufacturing/nanofabrication.

For a given requirement on the rate outage probability for receivers, we aim to maximize the system utility (e.g., the weighted sum rate, weighted proportional fairness rate, and the weighed harmonic mean rate) subject to the rate outage constraints and individual power constraints. The outage constraints, however, lead to a complicated, nonconvex structure for the considered beamforming design problem and make the optimization problem difficult to handle. While this nonconvex optimization problem can be solved in an exhaustive search manner, this brute-force approach is only feasible when the number of transmitter-receiver pairs is small. For a system with a large number of transmitter-receiver pairs, computationally efficient alternatives are necessary. The focus of this paper is hence on the design of such efficient approximation methods. In particular, by employing semidefinite relaxation (SDR) and first-order approximation techniques, we propose an efficient successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm that provides high-quality approximate beamforming solutions via solving a sequence of convex approximation problems. The solution thus obtained is further shown to be a stationary point for the SDR of the original outage constrained beamforming design problem. In addition, we propose a decentralized SCA algorithm where each transmitter optimizes its own beamformer using only local CDI. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed SCA algorithm and its decentralized counterpart indeed converge, and near-optimal performance can be obtained for all the considered system utilities.",This paper has been withdrawn by the author due to some flaws in the proof of theorem 1,30

The induced circular dichroism (ICD) strength is several orders greater than the molecular inherent CD (MCD), and it generally appears at visual range (VR) where the CD signal is easily detectable. Therefore, the ICD is considered as a potential method to detect single molecular chirality. In this study, cross shaped nanohole (CSN) is proposed for enhancing the MCD signal. The maximum enhancement of the structure reached 450 folds of molecular inherent MCD. Through analysis of the surface plasmon resonance mode, it is found that overlapping of the electric dipole (ED) and magnetic dipole (MD) surface plasmon resonance (SPR) in CSN is essential for the CD enhancement. Furthermore, we investigated the effects of the thickness of structure, length of longer and shorter arms of nanohole, the displacement of shorter arm of the nanohole and x period of CSN on the circular dichroism enhancement, and found the enhancement factor and location of CD enhancement peak to be tunable by the structural parameters","Figure 3 is drawn by incorrect data.

2206.00371v2,2206.00371v1,Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO),Dynamic Complexity of Group Problems,"Dynamic Complexity was introduced by Immerman and Patnaik PI97 in the nineties and has seen a resurgence of interest with the positive resolution of their conjecture on directed reachability in DynFO DKMSZ18. Since then many natural problems related to reachability and matching have been placed in DynFO and related classes DMVZ18,DKMTVZ20,DTV21. In this work, we place some dynamic problems from group theory in DynFO. In particular, suppose we are given an arbitrary multiplication table over n elements representing an unstructured binary operation (representing a structure called a magma). Suppose the table evolves through a change in one of its n^2 entries in one step. For a set S of magma elements which also changes one element at a time, we can maintain enough auxiliary information so that when the magma is a group, we are able to answer the Cayley Group Membership (CGM) problem for S and a target t (i.e. ""Is t a product of elements from S?
"") using an FO query at every step. This places the dynamic CGM problem (for groups) when the ambient magma is specified via a table in DynFO. In contrast, for the table setting, statically CGM was known to be in the class Logspace BarringtonM06. Building on the dynamic CGM result, we can maintain the isomorphism of of two magmas, whenever both are Abelian groups, in DynFO. Our techniques include a way to maintain the powers of the elements of a magma in DynFO using left associative parenthesisation, the notion of cube independence to cube generate a subgroup generated by a set, a way to maintain maximal cube independent sequences in a magma along with some group theoretic machinery available from McKenzieCook. The notion of cube independent sequences is new as far as we know and may be of independent interest. These techniques are very different from the ones employed in Dynamic Complexity so far.","The paper has been withdrawn since some crucial lemmas are wrong (Theorem 1, Lemma 10) related to cube bases.

The goal is to remove a minimum weight collection of edges from the graph such that there is no path between any pair of terminals. The $k$-terminal cut problem is known to be NP-hard. There has been interest in determining special classes of graphs for which $k$-terminal cut can be solved in polynomial time. One special class of graphs is the class of $\gamma$-stable graphs, a notion introduced by Bilu and Linial. An instance of $k$-terminal cut is said to be $\gamma$-stable if edges in the cut can be multiplied by up to $\gamma$ without changing the unique optimal solution. For several years, the best-known result for $\gamma$-stable instances of $k$-terminal cut stated that the problem can be solved in polynomial time for $\gamma \geq 4$ by solving a certain linear program. This result was recently improved to $\gamma \geq 2 - 2/k$ using the same linear program. In this paper, we match the result with a completely different approach, showing that $\gamma$-stable instances of $k$-terminal cut can be solved in polynomial time for $\gamma \geq 2 - 2/k$, with a faster algorithm. The result is surprising: we show that a known $(2 - 2/k)$-approximation algorithm for the problem actually delivers the unique optimal solution for $(2 - 2/k)$-stable graphs. For all graphs, including those which are not $(2-2/k)$-stable, there is an easy-to-check certificate to determine if the output of the algorithm is optimal.

In this paper, we give novel lower and matching upper bounds for the multi-message broadcast problem and its well studied special cases. These problems ask to broadcast k messages, initially residing in an arbitrary set of nodes, to all nodes in a radio network. This work is the first to show that the throughput of these tasks differs quadratically depending on whether nodes route information or use network coding. In particular, we show a direct sum type lower bound for routing: Alon et al. showed that in radius-2 networks with n nodes broadcasting one message needs Omega(log^2 n) time. We show that in the same family of networks k * \tilde{Omega}(log^2 n) rounds are needed to distribute k messages using routing, even in a centralized setting. This stands in contrast to network coding based solutions that complete in Theta(k log n + log^2 n) rounds. Besides identifying and fully characterizing the coding gap in radio networks, our routing lower bound also disproves a previously published O(n log n) routing algorithm for gossiping k=n messages. This work is also the first to give optimal (distributed) k-message broadcast algorithms for radio networks with known topology. Their running times are O(D + k log n + log^2 n) using network coding and O(D + k log^2 n) using routing, where D is the diameter of the network. Lastly, we show that the direct sum result for routing does not hold in radius-2 networks with small maximum receiver degree Delta < log n. We give a novel routing scheme based on Baranyai's celebrated theorem that achieves a complexity of k * O(Delta^2). We also present a k * \tilde{Omega}(Delta) lower bound.

1211.2986v2,1211.2986v1,Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO),A Strongly Grounded Stable Model Semantics for Full Propositional Language,"Answer set programming is one of the most praised frameworks for declarative programming in general and non-monotonic reasoning in particular. There has been many efforts to extend stable model semantics so that answer set programs can use a more extensive syntax. To such endeavor, the community of non-monotonic reasoning has introduced extensions such as equilibrium models and FLP semantics. However, both of these extensions suffer from two problems: intended models according to such extensions (1) are not guaranteed to be minimal, and (2) more importantly, may have self-justifications (i.e., the justification for pertinence of an atom in an intended model may be its own pertinence). Both of these properties directly violate the spirit of stable model semantics. Therefore, we believe that we need a new extension of stable model semantics that guarantees both minimality and being strongly grounded. This paper introduces one such extension using two different approaches: firstly, by extending the goal-reachability interpretation of logic programs to the full propositional language and, secondly, using derivability in intuitionistic propositional logic. We show that both these approaches give the same semantics, that we call the supported semantics. Moreover, using the first approach, we also extend well-founded semantics to full propositional language. Furthermore, we discuss how our supported models relate to other existing semantics for non-monotonic reasoning including the equilibrium models. Last, but not the least, we discuss the complexity of reasoning about supported models and show that all interesting reasoning tasks (such as brave/cautious reasoning) are PSPACE-complete. Therefore, supported model semantics is a much more expressive semantics then the existing semantics such as equlibrium models (that have reasoning procedures in $\Delta^P_3$).","This paper has been withdrawn due to a mistake in the intended proof for Theorem 10 and, thus Corollary 4, does not work.

While the convexity assumption allows for technical shortcuts and generally leads to strict convergence, dealing with the non-convex framework, on the contrary, requires the use of specific results as those relying on the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz (KL) theory. While such tools have become popular in the field of deterministic optimisation, they are much less widespread in the stochastic context and, in this case, the few works making use of them are essentially based on trajectory-by-trajectory approaches. In this paper, we propose a new methodology, also based on KL theory, for deeper asymptotic investigations on a stochastic scheme verifying a descent condition. The specificity of our work is here to be of macroscopic nature insofar as our strategy of proof is more in-expectation-based and therefore seems more natural typically with respect to the noise properties, of conditional order, encountered in the stochastic literature nowadays.",Mathematical mistake in section 5 (lemma 5.5 and so theorem 5.6),29

Our algorithm greatly improves upon the error of prior algorithms, namely $\widetilde{O}(n^{2/3}/\varepsilon)$ and $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{n}/\varepsilon)$ in the two respective settings, and is the first to be optimal up to a polylogarithmic factor, based on a lower bound of $\widetilde{\Omega}(n^{1/4})$. In the case where a multiplicative approximation is allowed, we give two different constructions of algorithms with reduced additive error. Our first construction allows a multiplicative approximation of $O(k\log{\log{n}})$ and has additive error $\widetilde{O}(k\cdot n^{1/k}/\varepsilon)$ in the $\varepsilon$-DP case and $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{k}\cdot n^{1/(2k)}/\varepsilon)$ in the $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-DP case.

As the width goes to infinity, the linearized NN converges to the NN in Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) regime \citep{jacot2018neural}. Thus, we can derive the \emph{a priori} generalization error of two-layer ReLU NN in NTK regime. The distance between NN in a NTK regime and a finite-width NN with gradient training is estimated by \cite{arora2019exact}. Based on the results in \cite{arora2019exact}, our work proves an \emph{a priori} generalization error bound of two-layer ReLU NNs. This estimate uses the intrinsic implicit bias of the minimum norm solution without requiring extra regularity in the loss function. This \emph{a priori} estimate also implies that NN does not suffer from curse of dimensionality, and a small generalization error can be achieved without requiring exponentially large number of neurons. In addition the research line proposed in this paper can also be used to study other properties of the finite-width network, such as the posterior generalization error.","There is a error in this paper that the scale of initialization in this paper is different from the NTK regime.

In this paper, the data-taking scheme is investigated to maximize the achievable precisions of the $W$ boson mass and width with a threshold scan, when various systematic uncertainties are taken into account.

Actually, even if predicates themselves are balanced, there is still a significant concept-imbalance within them due to the long-tailed distribution of contexts (i.e., subject-object combinations). This concept-level imbalance poses a more pervasive and challenging issue compared to the predicate-level imbalance since subject-object pairs are inherently complex in combinations. Hence, we introduce a novel research problem: Generalized Unbiased Scene Graph Generation (G-USGG), which takes into account both predicate-level and concept-level imbalance. To the end, we propose the Multi-Concept Learning (MCL) framework, which ensures a balanced learning process across rare/ uncommon/ common concepts. MCL first quantifies the concept-level imbalance across predicates in terms of different amounts of concepts, representing as multiple concept-prototypes within the same class. It then effectively learns concept-prototypes by applying the Concept Regularization (CR) technique. Furthermore, to achieve balanced learning over different concepts, we introduce the Balanced Prototypical Memory (BPM), which guides SGG models to generate balanced representations for concept-prototypes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the remarkable efficacy of our model-agnostic strategy in enhancing the performance of benchmark models on both VG-SGG and OI-SGG datasets, leading to new state-of-the-art achievements in two key aspects: predicate-level unbiased relation recognition and concept-level compositional generability.","The author requests to withdraw this paper due to a critical definitional error in Multi-Concept Learning for Generalized Unbiased SGG Debiasing.

General Relativity is reestablished by cancelling the torsion thus generated, which provides constraints on the invariants and yield the form of the effective cosmological constant. As it is divided by the total volume of spacetime, its small value compared to the Planck scale is therefore natural. It also provides a direct measurement of the global Euler number.","The problem presented is ill-defined and therefore the solutions are not consistent as claimed.

The state features of the agent are learned from the weight statistics of the optimizee during training. The reward function of this agent is designed to learn policies that minimize the optimizee's training time given a certain performance goal. The actions of the agent correspond to changing the learning rate for the optimizee during training.

2304.07484v2,2304.07484v1,Statistics Theory (math.ST),On the existence of Firth's modified estimates in logistic regression models,"In logistic regression modeling, Firth's modified estimator is widely used to address the issue of data separation, which results in the nonexistence of the maximum likelihood estimate. Firth's modified estimator can be formulated as a penalized maximum likelihood estimator in which Jeffreys' prior is adopted as the penalty term. Despite its widespread use in practice, the formal verification of the corresponding estimate's existence has not been established. In this study, we establish the existence theorem of Firth's modified estimate in binomial logistic regression models, assuming only the full column rankness of the design matrix. We also discuss multinomial logistic regression models. Unlike the binomial regression case, we show through an example that the Jeffreys-prior penalty term does not necessarily diverge to negative infinity as the parameter diverges.",Mistake in the calculation of Example 4,7

It is endowed with mass dimension three-half. Combined, these characteristics profoundly affect the phenomenology of the high energy physics, astrophysics, and cosmology. We here present a counter example by providing a local, mass dimension one, Fermi field of spin one-half. The theory, inter alia, thus allows dimensionless quartic self interaction for the new fermions, and its only other dimensionless coupling is quadratic in the new fermions and in the standard-model scalar field. For these reasons, the immediate application of the new theory resides in the dark-matter sector of physical reality. The lowest-mass associated new particle may leave its unique signature at the Large Hadron Collider. We discuss in detail the theoretical crevice that allows the existence of the new quantum field.","This paper is withdrawn due to a crucial error in Eq.(102).

Such channels are information stable, hence their Shannon capacity exists. However, computation of the channel capacity is formidable, and only some upper and lower bounds on the capacity (for some special cases) exist. In this short paper, using a simple methodology, we prove that the channel capacity is a convex function of the stochastic channel matrix. Since the more widely studied model of an independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) deletion channel is a particular case, as an immediate corollary to this result we also argue that the i.i.d. deletion channel capacity is a convex function of the deletion probability. We further use this result to improve the existing capacity upper bounds on the deletion channel by a proper ""convexification"" argument. In particular, we prove that the capacity of the deletion channel, as the deletion probability d --> 1, is upper bounded by $0.4143(1-d)$ (which was also observed by a different (weaker) recent result).","The paper is withdrawn from Arxiv due to a gap in the proof of Lemma 2.

The triangle T is the ""tile"". The tile may or may not be similar to ABC. We wish to understand possible tilings by completely characterizing the triples (ABC, T, N) such that ABC can be N-tiled by T. In particular, this understanding should enable us to specify for which N there exists a tile T and a triangle ABC that is N-tiled by T; or given N, to determine which tiles and triangles can be used for N-tilings; or given ABC, to determine which tiles and N can be used to N-tile ABC. This is the fifth paper in a series of papers on this subject. The previous papers have reduced the problem the case when T has a 120 degree angle and integer side lengths. That is the problem we take up in this paper. We are still not able to completely solve the problem, but we prove that if there are any N-tilings by such tiles, then N is at least 96. Combining this results with our earlier work, we can remove the exception for a tile with a 120 degree angle, obtaining definitive non-existence results. For example, there is no 7-tiling, no 11-tiling, no 14-tiling, no 19-tiling, no 31-tiling, no 41-tiling, etc. Regarding the number N=96: There are several possible shapes of ABC, and for each shape, we exhibit the smallest N for which it is presently unknown whether there is an N-tiling. For example, for equilateral ABC, the simplest unsolved case as of May, 2012 is N=135. For each of these minimal-N examples, the tile would have to have sides (3,5,7).","Theorem 1 is wrong; tilings described in later papers contradict it.

Thus it is impossible to reconstruct the location of the underlying scatterers. By adding a reference point scatterer into the model, we show that the nature of the scatterer can be uniquely determined by the phaseless data. In particular, under a priori assumptions on the scatterer, uniqueness for one plane wave can also be established. The reference point technique not only overcomes the translation invariance, but also brings a practical phase retrieval algorithm. We design a novel direct sampling method using the phaseless data directly and propose a combination method with the novel phase retrieval algorithm and the classical direct sampling methods. Numerical examples in two dimensions are also presented to demonstrate their feasibility and effectiveness.","In sections 2-3, neglection multiple scattering between the original scatterer and the reference point scatterer is not rigorous",21

We work in the Rydberg blockade regime for the ensemble atoms induced due to excitation of the control atom to a high lying Rydberg level. It is shown that using STIRAP, atoms from one ground state of the ensemble can be adiabatically transferred to the other ground state, depending on the state of the control atom, with high fidelity. A thorough analysis of adiabatic conditions for this scheme and the influence of radiative decay from the excited Rydberg levels is provided.

However, since community detection methods have random factors and real social networks obtained from complex systems always contain error edges, evaluating the significance of community structure partitioned is an urgent and important question. In this paper, integrating the specific characteristics of real society, we present a novel framework analyzing the significance of social community specially. The dynamics of social interactions are modeled by identifying social leaders and corresponding hierarchical structures. Instead of a direct comparison with the average outcome of a random model, we compute the similarity of a given node with the leader by the number of common neighbors. To determine the membership vector, an efficient community detection algorithm is proposed based on the position of nodes and their corresponding leaders. Then, using log-likelihood score, the tightness of community can be derived. Based on the distribution of community tightness, we establish a new connection between $p$-value theory and network analysis and then get a novel statistical form significance measure. Finally, the framework is applied to both benchmark networks and real social networks. Experimental results show that our work can be used in many fields, such as determining the optimal number of communities, analyzing the social significance of a given community, comparing the performance among various algorithms and so on.",This paper has been withdrawn by the author due to a crucial error in equation (17) and high overlapping rate,22

Chambers {\it et al.} (Phys. Rev. Lett. 118, 242001 (2017), arXiv:1703.01153 ) that the time-ordered current-curent correlator in the nucleon calculated on the lattice is to be identified as the forward Compton amplitude so that it is related to the sum of the even moments of the structure function as in the Minkowski space in the continuum. We point out two problems with this identification. First of all, the current-current correlator defined in the Euclidean space is not analytic everywhere on the rest of the complex $\nu$ or $\omega$ plane, besides the cuts on the real axis. As such, there is no dispersion relation to relate it to its imaginary part and hence the moments of the structure function. On the lattice, there is an additional difficulty in that the higher dimensional local operators from the operator production expansion (OPE) of the current-current product can mix with lower dimensional higher-twist operators which leads to divergences in the powers of inverse lattice spacing. This mixing needs to be removed before their matrix elements can be identified as the moments of the structure function.",This article has been withdrawn by the author.

In these experiments, extracting the subtle influence of the ionic potential on the departing electrons is of capital importance, and often challenging. Here we show that molecular chirality naturally provides a solution to this issue by breaking the symmetry of the photoionization process along the laser propagation direction. Using counter-rotating bicircular bichromatic laser fields, we produce two families of electrons with distinct ionization dynamics. Their overlap in momentum space results in quantum interferences, which are extremely sensitive to molecular chirality. The angular streaking of the electrons by the rotating laser field acts as an attoclock, encoding the ionization dynamics onto the electron ejection angle. Chirosensitive forward/backward asymmetries reveal the short and long spatial range influence of the ionic potential in the ionization process.",Paper withdrawn because the interpretation is incorrect.

1602.07484v2,1602.07484v1,Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el),New many-particle system consisting of electron pairs and holes in a two-dimensional crystal,"When atoms are organized into a crystal, the single-electron energy levels of individual atoms form energy bands. However, there also exist electron-pair states in atoms. We found previously that the counterpart of these electron-pair states of individual atoms may survive in a two-dimensional square-lattice crystal. When the amplitude of the crystal potential is larger than a certain value, a metastable electron-pair band arises between the two lowest single-electron energy bands. In this paper, we demonstrate that the many-particle exchange-correlation corrections renormalize the energy bands and may stabilize the electron pairs for certain hole and electron-pair densities in the two-dimensional crystal. Therefore, depending upon the crystal potential and free carrier densities, there may exist a new many-particle system consisting of electron pairs and holes. Furthermore, we calculate the charge-density excitation spectrum in this new many-particle system.","In this manuscript, we dealt with a system with holes in a single-electron band interacting with electron pairs.

1408.3745v2,1408.3745v1,Classical Physics (physics.class-ph),Classical Interaction of a Magnet and a Point Charge: The Classical Electromagnetic Forces Responsible for the Aharonov-Bohm Phase Shift,"A new classical electromagnetic analysis is presented suggesting that the Aharonov-Bohm phase shift is overwhelmingly likely to arise from a classical lag effect based upon classical electromagnetic forces. The analysis makes use of several aspects of classical electromagnetic theory which are unfamiliar to most physicists, including the Darwin Lagrangian, acceleration-based electric fields, internal electromagnetic momentum in a magnet, and a magnet model involving at least three mutually-interacting particles. Only when the acceleration-based electric forces acting on the passing charge are included do we find consistency with all the relativistic conservation laws: energy, linear momentum, angular momentum, and constant center-of-mass velocity. The electric forces on the passing charge lead to a lag effect which accounts quantitatively for the Aharonov-Bohm phase shift. Thus the classical analysis strongly suggests that the Aharonov-Bohm phase shift (observed when electrons pass a long solenoid which corresponds to a line of magnetic dipoles) is the analogue of the Matteucci-Pozzi phase shift (observed when electrons pass a line of electric dipoles). The classical electromagnetic analysis suggests experiments to distinguish the proposed classical-based lag effect from the presently accepted view that the Aharonov-Bohm phase shift is a quantum topological effect arising from magnetic fluxes in the absence of classical electromagnetic forces.",This paper has been withdrawn by the author due to a error in Eq.

Specifically, given sampling and query access to a matrix $A\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ and a vector $b\in\mathbb{R}^m$, we propose classical algorithms that produce a data structure for the solution $x\in\mathbb{R}^{n}$ of the linear system $Ax=b$ with the ability to sample and query its entries. The resulting $x$ satisfies $\|x-A^{+}b\|\leq\epsilon\|A^{+}b\|$, where $\|\cdot\|$ is the spectral norm and $A^+$ is the Moore-Penrose inverse of $A$. Our algorithm has time complexity $\widetilde{O}(\kappa_F^4/\kappa\epsilon^2)$ in the general case, where $\kappa_{F} =\|A\|_F\|A^+\|$ and $\kappa=\|A\|\|A^+\|$ are condition numbers. Compared to the prior state-of-the-art result [Shao and Montanaro, arXiv:2103.10309v2 ], our algorithm achieves a polynomial speedup in condition numbers. When $A$ is $s$-sparse, our algorithm has complexity $\widetilde{O}(s \kappa\log(1/\epsilon))$, matching the quantum lower bound for solving linear systems in $\kappa$ and $1/\epsilon$ up to poly-logarithmic factors [Harrow and Kothari]. When $A$ is $s$-sparse and symmetric positive-definite, our algorithm has complexity $\widetilde{O}(s\sqrt{\kappa}\log(1/\epsilon))$. Technically, our main contribution is the application of the heavy ball momentum method to quantum-inspired classical algorithms for solving linear systems, where we propose two new methods with speedups: quantum-inspired Kaczmarz method with momentum and quantum-inspired coordinate descent method with momentum. Their analysis exploits careful decomposition of the momentum transition matrix and the application of novel spectral norm concentration bounds for independent random matrices.

Moreover these variabilities, also known as inter-subject or inter-session variabilities, require lengthy calibration sessions before the BCI system can be used. Furthermore, the calibration session has to be repeated for each subject independently and before use of the BCI due to the inter-session variability. In this study, we present an algorithm in order to minimize the above-mentioned variabilities and to overcome the time-consuming and usually error-prone calibration time. Our algorithm is based on linear programming support-vector machines and their extensions to a multiple kernel learning framework. We tackle the inter-subject or -session variability in the feature spaces of the classifiers. This is done by incorporating each subject- or session-specific feature spaces into much richer feature spaces with a set of optimal decision boundaries. Each decision boundary represents the subject- or a session specific spatio-temporal variabilities of neural signals. Consequently, a single classifier with multiple feature spaces will generalize well to new unseen test patterns even without the calibration steps. We demonstrate that classifiers maintain good performances even under the presence of a large degree of BCI variability.

The calculation of its thermal relic abundance without (with) the Sommerfeld effect suggests that the observed value corresponds to the mass of the dark matter particle $m_0 \gtrsim 8.8~(25)~\mathrm{TeV}$. Two extra quartic couplings $\lambda_2$ and $\lambda_3$ introduced in this model affect the running of other couplings, and hence the vacuum stability and the perturbativity up to the Planck scale. Therefore, the vacuum stability and the perturbativity conditions can constrain these couplings into a narrow region in the $\lambda_2$-$\lambda_3$ plane. Other constraints from $h\to\gamma\gamma$, electroweak oblique parameters, and direct and indirect DM searches are also investigated. Moreover, we survey the vacuum stability and the perturbativity in the model combining the septuplet with the Type-I or Type-III seesaw. The running of couplings is further altered when the energy scale goes above the seesaw scale. In the Type-I case, when the seesaw scale $\sim 10^{15}~\mathrm{GeV}$, the vacuum stability condition makes the acceptable region in the $\lambda_2$-$\lambda_3$ plane much narrower.

The proof is based on a connection with the theory of Tur_n determinants of orthogonal polynomials. We also discuss some applications to the problem that originally motivated the conjecture.","The estimate in Lemma 1 is wrong. This invalidates the result. Quoting v1, the error is in the substitution of the first entry of the hypergeometric 3F2, formula (3.3)).

Compared to standard additive homomorphic algorithms like Paillier, this algorithm reduces the computational cost of encryption and decryption from modular exponentiation to modular multiplication, and reduces the computational cost of ciphertext addition from modular multiplication to modular addition. This algorithm is based on a new mathematical problem: in two division operations, whether it is possible to infer the remainder or divisor based on the dividend when two remainders are related. Currently, it is not obvious how to break this problem, but further exploration is needed to determine if it is sufficiently difficult. In addition to this mathematical problem, we have also designed two interesting mathematical structures for decryption, which are used in the two algorithms mentioned in the main text. It is possible that the decryption structure of Algorithm 2 introduces new security vulnerabilities, but we have not investigated this issue thoroughly.",This algorithm proposed in this paper has serious security problem.

These groupoids are employed towards a generic construction method for finite hypergraphs that realise specified overlap patterns and avoid small cyclic configurations. The constructions are based on reduced products with groupoids generated by the elementary local extension steps, and can be made to preserve the symmetries of the given overlap pattern. In particular, we obtain highly symmetric, finite hypergraph coverings without short cycles. The groupoids and their application in reduced products are sufficiently generic to be applicable to other constructions that are specified in terms of local glueing operations and require global finite closure.","Explicit completion of H in HxI (Section 2) is unstable (incompatible with restrictions), hence does not support inductive construction towards Prop. 2.17 based on Lem 2.16 as claimed.

The interaction between qubits and electromagnetic fields can provide additional coupling channels to qubit states, leading to quantum interference in a microwave driven qubit. In particular, the interwell relaxation or Rabi oscillation, resulting respectively from the multi- or single-mode interaction, can induce effective crossovers. The environment is modeled by a multi-mode thermal bath, generating the interwell relaxation. Relaxation induced interference, independent of the tunnel coupling, provides deeper understanding to the interaction between the qubits and their environment. It also supplies a useful tool to characterize the relaxation strength as well as the characteristic frequency of the bath. In addition, we demonstrate the relaxation can generate population inversion in a strongly driving two-level system. On the other hand, different from Rabi oscillation, Rabi oscillation induced interference involves more complicated and modulated photon exchange thus offers an alternative means to manipulate the qubit, with more controllable parameters including the strength and position of the tunnel coupling. It also provides a testing ground for exploring nonlinear quantum phenomena and quantum state manipulation, in not only the flux qubit but also the systems with no crossover structure, e.g. phase qubits.",This paper has been withdrawn by the author due to a crucial error in equation 5,15

One reason is that the twist appears to be highly chaotic and there are other interesting things about the algebras to focus attention upon. However, if one uses a doubling product for the algebras different from yet equivalent to the ones commonly used and if one uses a numbering of the basis vectors different from the standard basis a quite beautiful and highly periodic twist emerges.

More specifically, we propose a novel tensor sparsification algorithm that retains a subset of the entries of a tensor in a judicious way, and prove that it can attain a given level of approximation accuracy in terms of tensor spectral norm with a much smaller sample complexity when compared with existing approaches. In particular, we show that for a $k$th order $d\times\cdots\times d$ cubic tensor of stable rank $r_s$, the sample size requirement for achieving a relative error $\varepsilon$ is, up to a logarithmic factor, of the order $r_s^{1/2} d^{k/2} /\varepsilon$ when $\varepsilon$ is relatively large, and $r_s d /\varepsilon^2$ and essentially optimal when $\varepsilon$ is sufficiently small. It is especially noteworthy that the sample size requirement for achieving a high accuracy is of an order independent of $k$. In addition, we show that for larger $\varepsilon$, the space complexity can be improved for higher order tensors ($k\ge 5$) by another sketching method via rank-one projection. To further demonstrate the utility of our techniques, we also study how higher order singular value decomposition (HOSVD) of large tensors can be efficiently approximated based on both sketching schemes.",An error was found in proving the performance bounds for the rank-one projection and is currently being fixed,43

Systems with an originally axial symmetry must show an intrinsic tendency to spontaneously violate this symmetry as soon as the condensation sets in, and the phase transition at the respective critical field may even become of first order. We can explain a number of features in the experimental data of various insulating spin systems, such as a slightly nonlinear magnetization near the critical field as well as hysteresis effects and peculiarities in the energy-level scheme of TlCuCl3. We also offer a consistent explanation for certain anomalies in the magnetocaloric effect and in the magnetization of BaCuSi2O6 by assuming a spontaneous violation of axial symmetry at the magnetic phase transition on an energy scale of about 1 micro-eV. The resulting anisotropy gap in the magnetic excitation spectrum, that inevitably forms at the critical field of all such systems, lifts the linear Goldstone mode and is therefore seriously limiting the lifetime of magnetic condensates to a few nanoseconds at most.","This paper has been withdrawn in present form because ch. 4.1 contains an invalid interpretation of M(H) below Hc, and because the ""rounding"" in M(H) discussed in 4.3. must be taken with more caution when comparing it to experimental data in ch. 5.

Terahertz science and technology could benefit from optomechanical approaches, which harness the interaction of light with miniature mechanical resonators [7,8]. So far, optomechanics has mostly focused on the optical and microwave domains, leading to new types of quantum experiments [9-11] and to the development of optical-microwave converters [12-14]. Here we propose and validate the concept of terahertz optomechanics, by coupling far-infrared photons to the mechanical degrees of freedom of the flexible part of a sub-wavelength split-ring resonator [15].

Furthermore, our device operates at room temperature and at high-frequency (>10MHz), well beyond the response speed of Golay cells, pyroelectric detectors and cryogenic semiconductor bolometers [16,17]. These properties makes it already ideally suited for applications relying on high speed bright terahertz sources such as quantum cascade lasers [18,19] and synchrotrons [20].

By generalizing Tasaki's work on the second law of thermodynamics for an adiabatic process between two equilibrium states of a macroscopic quantum compound system, we obtain an extension of the second law to a transient adiabatic process that takes a macroscopic quantum compound system consisting of a system of interest and two heat reservoirs from an initial equilibrium state to a final non-equilibrium state, where the system of interest is in a steady heat conduction state. For the system of interest, we define its generalized entropy so that it becomes an experimentally measurable quantity and exactly satisfies an extension of the Clausius relation.

Our motivation is to represent and characterize an input image by a set of local descriptors extracted at characteristic points (i.e. keypoints) within the image. Then, dissimilarity measure between images is calculated based on the geometric distance between the topological feature spaces (i.e. manifolds) formed by the sets of local descriptors generated from these images. In this work, we propose to extract and use the local extrema pixels as our feature points.

Hence, each image is encoded by a LED feature point cloud and riemannian distances between these point clouds enable us to tackle CBIR.

Spectroscopy of single-axis noise using dynamical decoupling pulse sequences has garnered much recent attention. Here we consider noise spectroscopy based on a spin-locking type pulse sequence, i.e. a continuous-wave (CW) on-resonance driving field. We show that a heuristic filter function approach produces a qualitatively correct (but quantitatively incorrect) result, whereas a 0th-order average Hamiltonian calculation is shown to agree with the result predicted by the generalized Bloch equations. We further calculate up to 2nd-order average Hamiltonian corrections and show the deviation from the generalized Bloch equation result. This shows that noise spectroscopy using continuous fields, in some cases simpler to implement and more robust to errors than pulsed schemes, can be rigorously analyzed and criteria for reliable measurements can be established. Finally, a solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance experiment is presented which demonstrates that the CW and pulsed methods agree within experimental error. The noise, due to magnetization fluctuations in a dipolar coupled proton spin bath, is found to obey a roughly 1/\omega\ power law decay in the range of frequencies \omega\ investigated.",This paper has been withdrawn by the author due to an error in Eqn.

Due to its importance to the Unique Games Conjecture, this problem garnered a great deal of interest from the research community. There are positive results for certain easy unique games (e.g., unique games on expanders), and an impossibility result for hard unique games. In this paper we show how to bypass the impossibility result by enlarging the alphabet sufficiently before repetition. We consider the case of unique games on small set expanders for two setups: (i) Strong small set expanders that yield easy unique games. (ii) Weaker small set expanders underlying possibly hard unique games as long as the game is mildly fortified. We show how to fortify unique games in both cases, i.e., how to transform the game so sufficiently large induced sub-games have bounded value. We then prove strong parallel repetition for the fortified games. Prior to this work fortification was known for projection games but seemed hopeless for unique games.","Bug: The idea was that the [RS] reduction from small set expansion (SSE) to unique games creates product structure without hurting completeness. Hence, like in Raz's parallel repetition, even conditioning on past winning, a typical round approximately simulates the original game. Sadly, SSE requires simulation conditioned on falling into the small set, which is not necessarily possible",23

Assuming a luminosity that is characteristic of BHB stars, the object's radial velocity and proper motions from the second data release of Gaia would imply that its Galactic rest-frame velocity exceeds its local escape velocity. Consequently, the object would be considered a hypervelocity star, which would prove particularly interesting because its Galactic trajectory points in our direction. However, based on the spectroscopic analysis of follow-up observations, we show that the object is actually a short-period ($P=0.14337069\pm0.00000018$\,d) single-lined spectroscopic binary system with a visible B-type star (effective temperature, $T_{\mathrm{eff}} = 15\,840\pm160$\,K, and surface gravity, $\log(g) = 4.86\pm0.04$) that is less luminous than typical BHB stars. Accordingly, the distance of the system is lower than originally thought, which renders its Galactic orbit bound to the Galaxy. Nevertheless, it is still an extreme halo object on a highly retrograde orbit. The abundances of He, C, N, O, Ne, Mg, Al, Si, S, and Ca are subsolar by factors from 3 to more than 100, while Fe is enriched by a factor of about 6. This peculiar chemical composition pattern is most likely caused by atomic diffusion processes. Combining constraints from astrometry, orbital motion, photometry, and spectroscopy, we conclude that the visible component is a stripped star of $0.25^{+0.15}_{-0.06}\,M_\odot$ that is evolving into a low-mass helium white dwarf. Based on the currently available data, the mass of the unseen compact companion is, with 99\% confidence, larger than $1.5\,M_\odot$, that is, it is most likely a neutron star or a black hole.

In the spirit of our previous works, [EJSI] and [EJB], we do this by first studying scale-invariant solutions which satisfy a one dimensional PDE system and proving that they may become singular in finite time for properly chosen initial data. We then prove local well-posedness for the $3D$ Euler equations in a natural regularity class which includes scale-invariant solutions. While these solutions have uniformly bounded vorticity from time zero until right before the blow-up time, they do not have finite energy. To remedy this, we cut off the scale-invariant data to ensure finite energy and prove that the corresponding local solution must also become singular in finite time. This paper focuses only on the analysis of the scale-invariant solutions themselves and the proof that they can become singular in finite time. The local well-posedness theorem and the cut-off argument are very close to those in [JSI] and [EJB] and are left for the companion paper [EJE2]. It is important to remark that while the fluid domain is the exterior of a cone, we prove global regularity for the axi-symmetric $3D$ Euler equations without swirl in the exact same regularity classes and in the same domain. It is quite possible that the methods we use can be adapted to establish finite-time singularity formation for $C^\infty$ finite-energy solutions to the $3D$ Euler equations on $\mathbb{R}^3_+$.","There was a sign error in the version of the axi-symmetric Euler equations that we have adopted.

As conjectured, the anyon sectors of the model correspond precisely to the irreducible representations of the quantum double algebra of $G$. Our proof consists of two main parts. In the first part, we construct for each irreducible representation of the quantum double algebra a pure state and show that the GNS representations of these pure states are pairwise disjoint anyon sectors. In the second part we show that any anyon sector is unitarily equivalent to one of the anyon sectors constructed in the first part. The first part of the proof crucially uses a description of the states in question as string-net condensates. Purity is shown by characterising these states as the unique states that satisfy appropriate sets of local constraints. At the core of the proof is the fact that certain groups of local gauge transformations act freely and transitively on collections of local string-nets. For the second part, we show that any anyon sector contains a pure state that satisfies all but a finite number of these constraints. Using known techniques we can then construct a pure state in the anyon sector that satisfies all but one of these constraints. Finally, we show explicitly that any such state must be a vector state in one of the anyon sectors constructed in the first part.","This paper has been withdrawn by the authors due to errors in Sec. 5 and the proof of Prop. 6.6, which states that the irreps $\pi_{RC}$ constructed in the paper are anyon sectors.

We refine our model with respect to uniform modulation and coding, as applied in LTE networks. Furthermore, the analytical analysis is extended also for ultra-dense deployments likely to happen in the 5-th generation of cellular networks.

Pomerance made this conjecture more precise and proposed that there are $x^{1-{\frac{\{1+o(1)\}\log\log\log x}{\log\log x}}}$ Carmichael numbers up to $x$. At the time, his data tables up to $25 \cdot 10^{9}$ appeared to support his conjecture. However, Pinch extended this data and showed that up to $10^{21}$, Pomerance's conjecture did not appear well-supported. Thus, the purpose of this paper is two-fold. First, we build upon the work of Pomerance and others to present an alternate conjecture regarding the distribution of Carmichael numbers that fits proven bounds and is better supported by Pinch's new data. Second, we provide another conjecture concerning the distribution of Carmichael numbers that significantly sharpens Pomerance's heuristic arguments. We also extend and update counts pertaining to pseudoprimes and Carmichael numbers, and discuss the distribution of One-Parameter Quadratic-Base Test pseudoprimes.","This paper has been withdrawn by the author because in [15] the authors show that if one assumes the widely believed Elliott-Halberstam conjecture then for any constant a<1 there exists C>0 such that there are more than x^a Carmichael numbers up to x, once x>C.

There is little mathematical basis for the Conjecture 1.0.2 but there is little here, except that it fits data in the limited range in which there is data; there are many functions one could construct that would do this. Corollary 1.0.3 is extremely unlikely to be true, if only for the reason that it postulates an asymptotic formula for C(x), the number of Carmichael numbers up to x, while no other conjecture makes such a strong statement(these conjectures all have a (1+o(1)) somewhere in an exponent, meaning that they assert asymptotic formulas for log(x/C(x)) rather than for C(x) itself).

But recently, it appeared that Lanczos coefficients and K-complexity show chaotic behavior in the LMG model and cannot distinguish saddle-dominated scrambling from chaos. In this paper, we compute Lanczos coefficients and K-complexity in an inverted harmonic oscillator. We find that they exhibit chaotic behavior, which agrees with the case of the LMG model.

The encoding in the second layer provides enough redundancy for local repair, while the overall code performs recovery of the data based on redundancy from both layers.

1805.06872v2,1805.06872v1,Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS),Coding for Interactive Communication with Small Memory and Applications to Robust Circuits,"Classically, coding theory has been concerned with the problem of transmitting a single message in a format which is robust to noise. Recently, researchers have turned their attention to designing coding schemes to make two-way conversations robust to noise. That is, given an interactive communication protocol $\Pi$, an \emph{interactive coding scheme} converts $\Pi$ into another communication protocol $\Pi'$ such that, even if errors are introduced during the execution of $\Pi'$, the parties are able to determine what the outcome of running $\Pi$ would be in a noise-free setting. We consider the problem of designing interactive coding schemes which allow the parties to simulate the original protocol using little memory. Specifically, given any communication protocol $\Pi$ we construct robust simulating protocols which tolerate a constant noise rate and require the parties to use only $O(\log d \log s)$ memory, where $d$ is the depth of $\Pi$ and $s$ is a measure of the size of $\Pi$. Prior to this work, all known coding schemes required the parties to use at least $\Omega(d)$ memory, as the parties were required to remember the transcript of the conversation thus far. Moreover, our coding scheme achieves a communication rate of $1-O(\sqrt{\varepsilon})$ over oblivious channels and $1-O(\sqrt{\varepsilon\log\log\tfrac{1}{\varepsilon}})$ over adaptive adversarial channels, matching the conjecturally optimal rates. Lastly, we point to connections between fault-tolerant circuits and coding for interactive communication with small memory.","There is a problem with the main results, i.e., Theorems 6.4 and 6.5.

In general, the complex transition density is converted to the real one with phase factor. In this study, we apply the complex transition density directly to the microscopic reaction model. We compare with scattering cross sections calculated with the real and complex transition densities in the frameworks of the optical model, the distorted wave Born approximation, and the coupled-channel (CC) calculation, respectively. In addition, we investigate the dependence of the phase factor for the transition density in the elastic and inelastic cross sections. The effect of the phase factor on the elastic and inelastic cross sections can be seen in the CC calculation. Finally, we found an important role of the phase factor in the nuclear elastic and inelastic scatterings.","I found a mistake. The sign of the phase depends on the direction of the transition.

There have been numerous efforts to reduce the cost of interviewing in these markets using a variety of signalling mechanisms, however, the theoretical properties of these mechanisms have not been systematically studied in models with rich preferences. In this paper we give theoretical guarantees for a variety of mechanisms, finding that these mechanisms must properly balance competition. We consider a random market in which agents' latent preferences are based on observed qualities, personal taste and (ex post) interview shocks and assume that following an interview mechanism a final stable match is generated with respect to preferences over interview partners. We study a novel many-to-many interview match mechanism to coordinate interviews and that with relatively few interviews, when suitably designed, the interview match yields desirable properties. We find that under the interview matching mechanism with a limit of $k$ interviews per candidate and per position, the fraction of positions that are unfilled vanishes quickly with $k$. Moreover the ex post efficiency grows rapidly with $k$, and reporting sincere pre-interview preferences to this mechanism is an $\epsilon$-Bayes Nash equilibrium. Finally, we compare the performance of the interview match to other signalling and coordination mechanisms from the literature.","Error in proof of Lemma 1 leaves a step unexplained, proof needs to be corrected and made more rigorous",31

However, the window of opportunity is closing fast. Geoengineering as the intentional and large-scale manipulation of the environment and in particular the climate is increasingly discussed as a complement to ongoing mitigation efforts. As a particular geoengineering approach, space-based geoengineering blocks or dissipates a fraction of incoming sunlight via many occulting membranes, located close to the Sun-Earth Lagrange 1 point. However, the mass of the proposed sunshades, around $10^7$-$10^8$ tons, and their associated cost render them about $10^3$ times more costly than terrestrial alternatives. In this article, we propose a novel sunshade concept, which is between $10^2$ to $10^3$ times lighter than the lightest existing sunshade concepts. This is achieved via a net zero-radiation pressure design, based on the use of diffractive metamaterials, removing one of the major constraints to reducing sunshade mass. The whole sunshade system has a total mass of approximately $6.2 \times 10^5$ tons and its deployment requires between $10^2$ to $10^3$ annual launches during a ten-year period. The achieved cost reduction might render space-based geoengineering competitive to terrestrial geoengineering approaches.","An error was found in equation 6 used for calculating the normal component of the radiation pressure (Fn).

Our algorithm has two main steps. In the first step, we apply mean shift algorithm with multiple features to estimate the center of the target in each frame. Target in the first frame is defined using an ellipse. Edge, texture, and intensity features are extracted from the first frame, and then mean shift algorithm is applied to each feature separately to find the center of ellipse related to that feature in the next frame. The center of ellipse will be the weighted average of these centers. By using mean shift actually we estimate the target movement between two consecutive frames. Once the correct ellipsoid in each frame is known, in the second step we apply the Dynamic Directional Gradient Vector Flow (DDGVF) version of active contour models, in order to find the correct boundary of tumors. We sample a few points on the boundary of active contour then translate those points based on the translation of the center of ellipsoid in two consecutive frames to determine the target movement. We use these translated sample points as an initial guess for active contour in the next frame.

The F-ADMM algorithm uses a \emph{Gauss-Seidel} scheme to update blocks of variables, but is flexible enough to allow a Jacobi scheme to update the variables within each block. It follows that special cases of F-ADMM include the fully Jacobi and the fully Gauss-Seidel updating strategies, which displays its flexibility. We prove, under common assumptions, that the iterates generated by F-ADMM converge to a solution from an arbitrary initial starting point. Although F-ADMM may be used in many big data settings, it is a particularly attractive option when the number of blocks is larger than the number of available machines. In this case, the data may be partitioned into groups so that each group consists of multiple blocks of variables. By applying F-ADMM to this partitioning of the data, we obtain algorithm H-ADMM that updates the grouped data in a Gauss-Seidel fashion, the blocks within each group in a Jacobi manner. Convergence of H-ADMM follows directly from the convergence properties of F-ADMM.

This one-dimensional feature abstractly represents image information, but it does not express well the detailed information of image. To address this issue, we use the proposed SRN which composed of BiLSTM and several Tanh-Dropout blocks (called BiLSTM-TDN), to further process DCNN one-dimensional features for highlighting the detail information of image. After the feature transform by BiLSTM-TDN, the recognition performance has been greatly improved. We conducted the experiments on six fine-grained image datasets. Except for FGVC-Aircraft, the accuracies of the proposed methods on the other datasets exceeded 99%.

The RSP has deployed many RAPs at different locations in a city. A shop wants to rent some RAPs, which can disseminate advertisements to vehicles with some probabilites. Then, it tries to select the minimal number of RAPs to finish the advertisement dissemination, in order to save the expenses. Meanwhile, the selected RAPs need to ensure that each vehicle's probability of receiving advertisement successfully is not less than a threshold. We prove that this RAP selection problem is NP-hard.

Under a stronger assumption, that the departure rates are proportional to the queue length in each server, we obtain a characterization of the stability region through a system of equations. We start by defining the mathematical model and the queueing discipline we will study. We then obtain irreducibility and monotonicity for the dynamics, which allow us to state our two main results. We then use this result to obtain instability conditions for two queueing networks for which stability is known: a medium access algorithm and an interference queueing network.",Incorrect assumption in Theorem 3.

The lepton family number is defined through a weak basis of SU(2) doublet in which the charged lepton mass matrix is a real and diagonal one. The lepton family number carried by the neutrino is defined with a left-handed current of the neutrino family. We study the time evolution of the lepton family number operator for Majorana neutrino. To be definite, we introduce the mass term at $t=0$ and study the time evolution of the lepton family number for the later time. Since the operator in flavor eigenstate is continuously connected to that of the mass eigenstate, the creation and annihilation operators for flavor eigenstates are related to those of mass eigenstates. The total lepton number of the Majorana neutrino is conserved. By choosing a specific flavor eigenstate of neutrino as an initial state, we compute the time evolution of all lepton family numbers. They are sensitive to Majorana and Dirac phases and also are sensitive to the absolute mass and mass hierarchy of neutrinos.","We explain the reason for the withdrawal. In sec.2, the relation between creation and annihilation operators of massless neutrinos and massive Majorana neutrinos were incorrect. Then the total lepton number is not conserved.

1602.03290v2,1602.03290v1,High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),Gravitational effects on the Higgs field within the Solar System,"The Higgs mechanism predicts, apart from the existence of a new scalar boson, the presence of a constant Higgs field that permeates all of space. The vacuum expectation value (VEV) of this field is affected by quantum corrections which are mainly generated by the self-interactions and couplings of the Higgs field to gauge bosons and heavy quarks. In this work we show that gravity can affect, in a non-trivial way, these quantum corrections through the finite parts of the one-loop contributions to the effective potential. In particular, we consider the corrections generated by the Standard Model Higgs self-interactions in slowly-varying weak gravitational backgrounds. The obtained results amount to the existence of non-negligible inhomogeneities in the Higgs VEV. Such inhomogeneities translate into spatial variations of the particle masses, and in particular of the proton-to-electron mass ratio. We find that these Higgs perturbations in our Solar System are controlled by the Eddington parameter, and are absent in pure General Relativity. Yet, they may be present in modified gravity theories. This predicted effect may be constrained by atomic clocks or high-resolution spectroscopic measurements, which could allow to improve current limits on modifications of Einstein's gravity.",This paper has been withdrawn by the authors due to an error detected in the inhomogeneous contribution to the effective potential,4

It is argued that this impression is illusive and that GLPT and QHPT belong to different classes: GLPT is typical enthalpic PT (Van-der-Waals-like) while QHPT (""deconfinement-driven"") is typical entropic PT. Subdivision of 1st-order fluid-fluid phase transitions into enthalpy- and entropy-driven subclasses was proposed previously [ arXiv:1403.8053 ]. Properties of enthalpic and entropic PTs differ significantly. Entropic PTs are always internal parts of more general and extended thermodynamic anomalies - domains with abnormal (negative) sign for the set of (usually positive) second derivatives of thermodynamic potential. Three of them are of primary importance: Gruneizen and thermal expansion and thermal pressure coefficients. Negative sign of these derivatives lead to violation of standard behavior and relative order in P-V plane for many iso-lines, e.g. isotherms, isentropes, shock adiabats etc. Entropic PTs have more complicated topology of stable and metastable areas within its two-phase region in comparison with conventional enthalpic (VdW-like) PTs. In particular, new additional metastable region, bounded by new additional spinodal, appears in the case of entropic PT. All the features of entropic PTs and accompanying abnormal thermodynamics region have transparent geometrical interpretation - multi-layered structure of thermodynamic surfaces for temperature, entropy and internal energy as a pressure-volume functions, e.g. T(P,V), S(P,V) and U(P,V).",This paper has been withdrawn by the author due to a mistake in equation 17 and figure 9(c),15

Various algorithms are proposed to solve the challenging OPF problem. Recent studies show that semidefinite programming (SDP) can either provide an exact or near global optima for many existing OPF problems. However, SDP-based approaches usually have the complexity growing exponentially with respect to the network size, which may not be suitable for large-scale OPF problem. In this paper, we rewrite the OPF problem as a combination of several non-convex subproblems. We then consider SDP convex relaxation on the subproblems instead of the relaxation on the centralized formulation commonly found in the literature. The formulation leads to new conditions of exact SDP convex relaxation that generalize some existing results. Based on the distributed formulation, we also develop algorithms to find a near global optimum for general OPF problems. A bound on the difference between the near global solution and the optimum is also established. An important feature of the proposed SDP algorithms is that the complexity only grows approximately linearly with respect to the network size. Numerical studies further demonstrate that the computational time of the proposed algorithms need noticeable shorter time than the existing SDP-based OPF solvers.","Updates: Proposition 1 holds only for chordal graphs, so the exact relaxation results in the rest of the paper are subject to change.

This paper shows a surprising fact: no Tibet diffuse events above 398TeV come from the gamma-ray sources newly detected above 100 TeV by LHAASO. Based on this observational fact, the contribution of sources unresolved by LHAASO to the Tibet diffuse events is estimated to be less than 31% above 398TeV with a 99% confidence level. Our result shows that unresolved sources make only a sub-dominant contribution to the Tibet diffuse events above 398 TeV and a large fraction of the events are truly a diffusive nature.","Calculations in Eq-(2) should have used the probability p that a Tibet diffuse gamma-ray event is of unresolved-source origin, but the parameter p in Eq-(2) is the probability that a gamma-ray event above 398 TeV from a source marginally detected by LHAASO is detected by the Tibet.

However, if one parameter is constrained by physical considerations, the Gaussian approximation fails and the flat prior is no longer the Jeffreys prior. In this paper we compute the correct Jeffreys prior for a multivariate normal distribution constrained in one dimension, and we apply it to the sum of neutrino masses $\Sigma m_\nu$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$.

Specifically, our scheme to retrieve the total valid bits incorporates the skilled techniques in both training phase and inference phase. In the network training, we design decimal weight regularization and 8-bit forward quantization to obtain the integer-oriented network representations. Moreover, we develop adaptive-bitwidth and non-uniform quantization strategy in the inference phase to find the neural network capacity, total valid bits. By allowing zero bitwidth, our adaptive-bitwidth quantization can execute the model reduction and valid bits finding simultaneously. In our extensive experiments, we first demonstrate that our total valid bits is a good indicator of neural network capacity. We also analyze the impact on network capacity from the network architecture and advanced training skills, such as dropout and batch normalization.",There an error in Average Valid Bits computation in figure 1 in page 2,7

2205.05906v3,2205.05906v2,Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con),High-$T\rm_{c}$ superconductivity of clathrate Y$_{3}$EuH$_{24}$,"Recent progress on theoretical predictions of ternary superhydrides and their subsequent experimental confirmations have introduced us with a new generation of superconductors, having the potential to realize the synthesis of the most anticipated room temperature superconductors. Motivated by the recent high pressure experiment on YH$_6$ and EuH$_6$, we have theoretically examined the stability as well as superconductivity by mixing the two compounds. Here we identified four phases capable of maintaining thermodynamic stability in the pressure range of 150-300 GPa, namely $Fm\bar{3}m$-Y$_{3}$EuH$_{24}$, $Cmmm$-YEuH$_{12}$, $Cmmm$-YEu$_{3}$H$_{24}$,$Immm$-YEu$_{3}$H$_{24}$. Among them, only $Fm\bar{3}m$-Y$_{3}$EuH$_{24}$ can maintain dynamically stability in the searched pressure range. The Allen-Dynes modified McMillan formula was used to further check the superconductivity of this phase, and the results reveal that the predicted superconducting transition temperature $T\rm_{c}$ of Y$_{3}$EuH$_{24}$ is approaching 220 K at 200 GPa. $Fm\bar{3}m$-Y$_{3}$EuH$_{24}$ has a nearly identical logarithmic average phonon frequency $\omega_{log}$ to YH$_{6}$, but its electron-phonon coupling (EPC) constant $\lambda$ is somewhat smaller than YH$_{6}$'s 2.56, resulting in a lower ultimate $T_{c}$ value.","The system involves europium, where ignoring f-electrons and inherent magnetism led to an overly high predicted Tc in superconductivity calculations.

Given a set of $n$ jobs with processing times $p_j$ and deadlines $d_j$, the problem is to select a subset of jobs such that the total processing time is maximized without violating the deadlines. In the midst of a flourishing line of research, Fischer and Wennmann have recently devised the sought-after $\widetilde O(P)$-time algorithm, where $P = \sum p_j$ is the total processing time of all jobs. This running time is optimal as it matches conditional lower bounds based on popular conjectures. However, $P$ is not the sole parameter one could parameterize the running time by. Indeed, they explicitly leave open the question of whether a running time of $\widetilde O(n + \max d_j)$ or even $\widetilde O(n + \max p_j)$ is possible. In this work, we show, somewhat surprisingly, that by a refined implementation of their original algorithm, one can obtain the asked-for $\widetilde O(n + \max d_j)$-time algorithm.","The runtime analysis is incorrect: the contribution of the processing times in [d_j - p_j, d_{j - 1}] is not taken into account.

Second-order cone (SOC) relaxation is used to achieve exact convexification. A fully distributed algorithm is then formulated corresponding to the given division of areas based on an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm, which is greatly simplified by exploiting the structure of active distribution networks (ADNs). The problem is solved for each area with very little interchange of boundary information between neighboring areas. The standard ADMM algorithm is extended using a varying penalty parameter to improve convergence. The validity of the method is demonstrated via numerical simulations on an IEEE 33-node distribution network, a PG&E 69-node distribution system, and an extended 137-node system.","This paper has been withdrawn by the author due to a crucial error in equations 11 and 26.

Inside the random tube, which is stationary and ergodic, non-interacting particles move straight with constant speed. Upon hitting the tube walls, they are reflected randomly, according to the cosine law: the density of the outgoing direction is proportional to the cosine of the angle between this direction and the normal vector. Steady state transport is studied by introducing an open tube segment as follows: We cut out a large finite segment of the tube with segment boundaries perpendicular to the tube axis. Particles which leave this piece through the segment boundaries disappear from the system. Through stationary injection of particles at one boundary of the segment a steady state with non-vanishing stationary particle current is maintained. We prove (i) that in the thermodynamic limit of an infinite open piece the coarse-grained density profile inside the segment is linear, and (ii) that the transport diffusion coefficient obtained from the ratio of stationary current and effective boundary density gradient equals the diffusion coefficient of a tagged particle in an infinite tube. Thus we prove Fick's law and equality of transport diffusion and self-diffusion coefficients for quite generic rough (random) tubes.","This paper will not be published, since it contains a serious flaw in eq.(25).",25

In the case of groups, the previous best algorithm for computing rank used polylogarithmic space. We reduce the best upper bounds on the complexity of computing rank for groups and for quasigroups. This paper proves that the rank problem for these algebraic structures can be verified by highly restricted models of computation given only very short certificates of correctness. Specifically, we prove that the problem of deciding whether the rank of a finite quasigroup, given as a Cayley table, is smaller than a specified number is decidable by a circuit of depth $O(\log \log n)$ augmented with $O(\log^2 n)$ nondeterministic bits. Furthermore, if the quasigroup is a group, then the problem is also decidable by a Turing machine using $O(\log n)$ space and $O(\log^2 n)$ bits of nondeterminism with the ability to read the nondeterministic bits multiple times. Finally, we provide similar results for related problems on other algebraic structures and other kinds of rank. These new upper bounds are significant improvements, especially for groups.

Among the fair matchings, even the best one in terms of welfare (SOSM) is inefficient. Moreover, any mechanism that improves welfare over the SOSM is manipulable by the students. First, we characterize the ""least manipulable"" mechanisms in this class: monotonically-promoting transformation proofness ensures that no student is better off by promoting their assigned school under the true preferences. Second, we use the notion that a matching is less unfair if it yields a smaller set of students whose priorities are violated, and define minimal unfairness accordingly. We then show that the Efficiency Adjusted Deferred Acceptance (EADA) mechanism is minimally unfair in the class of efficient and monotonically-promoting transformation proof mechanisms.

The proposed transformation aims to enable an explicit expression of wall-shear stress and simplify the implementation of existing wall functions in simulation codes through a simple transformation of variables. The transformation is defined by introducing a new velocity scale allowing the definition of the new wall unit variable $(r^+)$ and the corresponding normalized viscosity $(\eta_t^+)$. We also demonstrate that the law of the wall in new variables is equivalent to the one expressed in wall-normal variables $(y^+_{\tau})$ and $(\nu_t^+)$. The new form of the law is particularly suitable for implementations in computational fluid dynamics codes as it does not require an iterative procedure to evaluate the wall shear stress.

Associative Processor combines data storage and data processing and provides parallel computational capabilities and data memory at the same time. An analytic performance model of the new computer architecture is introduced.

We then give a self-contained proof of the local asymptotic mixed normality (LAMN) property when the process is observed continuously in a time interval $[0; T]$ as $T\to\infty$, and derive, as a consequence, the local asymptotic normality (LAN) property in the ergodic case. For this, we give a proof of a Girsanov's theorem and a Central Limit theorem for a pure jump martingale. Our results could be viewed as a consequence of the LAMN property for semimartingales proved by Luschgy [15], using the Girsanov's theorem for semimartingales obtained in Jacod and Shiryaev [9], and the Central Limit theorem for semimartingales established by S_rensen [21] and Feigin [3].

The generalized eigenvalue problem (GEP) plays a vital role in a large family of high-dimensional statistical models. However, the existing distributed method for eigenvalue decomposition cannot be applied in GEP for the divergence of the empirical covariance matrix. Here we propose a general distributed GEP framework with one-shot communication for GEP. If the symmetric data covariance has repeated eigenvalues, e.g., in canonical component analysis, we further modify the method for better convergence. The theoretical analysis on approximation error is conducted and the relation to the divergence of the data covariance, the eigenvalues of the empirical data covariance, and the number of local servers is analyzed.

The main challenge is to transfer knowledge contained in the seen classes to unseen ones. Previous methods mostly transfer knowledge through sharing representation space or joint label space. However, they tend to neglect the class relation between seen and unseen categories, and thus the learned representations are less effective for clustering unseen classes. In this paper, we propose a principle and general method to transfer semantic knowledge between seen and unseen classes. Our insight is to utilize mutual information to measure the relation between seen classes and unseen classes in a restricted label space and maximizing mutual information promotes transferring semantic knowledge. To validate the effectiveness and generalization of our method, we conduct extensive experiments both on novel class discovery and general novel class discovery settings. Our results show that the proposed method outperforms previous SOTA by a significant margin on several benchmarks.",The derivation of Mutual Information in the manuscript is wrong,11

With the decoherence increasing, more vibrational degrees of freedom couple in, making the ordinary cooling method less effective or even fail. We propose an improved cooling method, which can eliminate the perturbation of additional vibrational degrees of freedom hence keep high efficiency even under the strong decoherence.

Second, we will prove that if the vorticity at $t=0$ can be decomposed into a scale-invariant part and a smoother part vanishing at $x=0$, then this decomposition remains valid for $t>0$ so long as the solution exists. This will then immediately imply singularity formation for finite-energy solutions in those critical spaces using that there are scale-invariant solutions which break down in finite time (this was proved in the companion paper [EJE1]). Third, we establish global regularity in the same domain and in the same scale of critical spaces for $0-$swirl solutions to the system. This implies that the finite-time singularity is not coming from the domain or the critical regularity of the data (though, these are important for the present construction), they are coming from a genuine vorticity growth mechanism due to the presence of the swirl. This work and the companion work seem to be the first case when this mechanism has been effectively used to establish finite-time singularity formation for the actual $3D$ Euler system.","There was a sign error in the version of the axi-symmetric Euler equations that we have adopted, and therefore there are corresponding sign errors in the 1D system that we have derived",29

Enormous amount of damages caused to infrastructures during recent earthquakes in all over the world indicate that there is a considerable room for improvement. Causes for extensive damages are generally attributed to poor soil conditions at the region. It is interesting to note that all structures in a region with poor soil condition do not suffer similar damages; in fact, some of them remain damage-free. There are many reasons for this including inability to model the soil-structural systems properly, predict the future design earthquake time history at the site, model the dynamic amplification of responses caused by the excitation, incorporate major sources of nonlinearity and energy dissipation, and most importantly consider the presence of a considerable amount of uncertainty at every phase of the evaluation process. The most recent research trend is to capture complicated behavior by conducting multiple deterministic analyses by taking advantage of current significantly improved computational capability. By conducting few dozens of deterministic analyses at very intelligently selected points, structures can be designed more seismic load-tolerant.

Privacy amplification against passive adversaries, where it is assumed that the communication is over a public but authenticated channel, can be achieved in the presence of classical as well as quantum side information by a single-message protocol based on strong extractors. In 2009 Dodis and Wichs devised a two-message protocol to achieve privacy amplification against active adversaries, where the public communication channel is no longer assumed to be authenticated, through the use of a strengthening of strong extractors called non-malleable extractors which they introduced. Dodis and Wichs only analyzed the case of classical side information. We consider the task of privacy amplification against active adversaries with quantum side information. Our main result is showing that the Dodis-Wichs protocol remains secure in this scenario provided its main building block, the non-malleable extractor, satisfies a notion of quantum-proof non-malleability which we introduce. We show that an adaptation of a recent construction of non-malleable extractors due to Chattopadhyay et al. is quantum proof, thereby providing the first protocol for privacy amplification that is secure against active quantum adversaries.

The confirmatory factor analysis was run using data from 2008, and led to the confirmation of this four-factor structure with very good fit measures. We also ran a set of structural equation models in an attempt to determine the causality links between these four factors. It was found that for the models which provide the best fit Belief in God does not cause Supernatural beliefs, Religious practice can cause Belief in God and that there are multiple paths leading to Belief in God, most of which include Religious formation as a source.

We thus obtain generic and canonical constructions of highly homogeneous graph structures with strong acyclicity properties, which possess known applications in finite graph and hypergraph coverings that locally unfold cyclic configurations.

In the discrete median line segment problem, the objective is to find a line segment bounded by a pair of points in $P$ such that the sum of the Euclidean distances from $P$ to the line segment is minimized. In the continuous median line segment problem, a real number $\ell>0$ is given, and the goal is to locate a line segment of length $\ell$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ such that the sum of the Euclidean distances between $P$ and the line segment is minimized. We show how to compute $(1+\epsilon\Delta)$- and $(1+\epsilon)$-approximations to a discrete median line segment in time $O(n\epsilon^{-2d}\log n)$ and $O(n^2\epsilon^{-d})$, respectively, where $\Delta$ is the spread of line segments spanned by pairs of points. While developing our algorithms, by using the principle of pair decomposition, we derive new data structures that allow us to quickly approximate the sum of the distances from a set of points to a given line segment or point. To our knowledge, our utilization of pair decompositions for solving minsum facility location problems is the first of its kind; it is versatile and easily implementable. We prove that it is impossible to construct a continuous median line segment for $n\geq3$ non-collinear points in the plane by using only ruler and compass. In view of this, we present an $O(n^d\epsilon^{-d})$-time algorithm for approximating a continuous median line segment in $\mathbb{R}^d$ within a factor of $1+\epsilon$. The algorithm is based upon generalizing the point-segment pair decomposition from the discrete to the continuous domain. Last but not least, we give an $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm, whose time complexity is sub-quadratic in $n$, for solving the constrained median line segment problem in $\mathbb{R}^2$ where an endpoint or the slope of the median line segment is given at input.","There is an error in the packing argument used to determine the number of well separated pairs/subsets.

Furthermore, refinements of our spectrum measurement allow for optimal estimation of further pertinent parameters, such as the sources relative intensity and their centroid.

The construction is based on a well-known model of machine teaching, referred to as recursive teaching dimension. This substantially improves on the currently best known bound on the size of sample compression schemes (due to Moran and Yehudayoff), which is exponential in $\VCD$. The long-standing open question whether the smallest size of a sample compression scheme is in $O(\VCD)$ remains unresolved, but our results show that research on machine teaching is a promising avenue for the study of this open problem. As further evidence of the strong connections between machine teaching and sample compression, we prove that the model of no-clash teaching, introduced by Kirkpatrick et al., can be used to define a non-trivial lower bound on the size of stable sample compression schemes.",Our main claim is wrong.

The combined effect of random impurity scattering and the spin-momentum locking of the gapless Dirac cone yields a current-induced surface spin accumulation independent from chemical potential and temperature. In a nearby ferromagnet that does not make direct contact with the topological insulator, the bound state nature of the pristine surface state causes a spin-transfer torque that is entirely field-like, whose magnitude is highly influenced by the interface cleanliness and the quantum well state of the ferromagnet. Through incorporating quantum tunneling into Bloch equation, the spin pumping mediated by the pristine surface state is shown to be described by the same spin mixing conductance as the spin-transfer torque, and a semiclassical approach is proposed to explain the inverse Edelstein effect that converts the spin pumping spin current into a charge current. Consistency of these results with various experiments will be elaborated in detail.","The wave function matching treatment for the spin-transfer torque turns out to be inadequate for topological insulators, hence this article should be withdrawn.

This new capability is mainly due to exploiting the concept of the real Lorentz-boost Pulse Co-Moving (LPCM) frame, in spite of previous studies. The theory is reduced to the well-known Quasi-Static Approximation (QSA) in the absence of the pulse evolutions, and shows excellent agreement with Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulations in terms of its new results. The obtained results show the extremely extra-ordinary nature of the fully nonlinear plasma physics of LWFA. It is turned out that the local group and phase velocities of the light are approximately equal. The obtained group-velocity evolves in time according to ( and are parameters depending on wake amplitude and initial group velocity) at early stages, showing non-explicit density dependency and remaining above the linear value over a long period of the propagation. The obtained equations for the carrier-mode, on the other hand, consistently suggest the emergence of a new dispersion branch with the linear relation ( is the light speed). Regarding these remarks, we expend on the plasma dispersion in details with the aid of simulations, confirming the observed anomalies and the emergence of the new branch.

2106.09385v3,2106.09385v2,Machine Learning (cs.LG),On Deep Neural Network Calibration by Regularization and its Impact on Refinement,"Deep neural networks have been shown to be highly miscalibrated. often they tend to be overconfident in their predictions. It poses a significant challenge for safety-critical systems to utilise deep neural networks (DNNs), reliably. Many recently proposed approaches to mitigate this have demonstrated substantial progress in improving DNN calibration. However, they hardly touch upon refinement, which historically has been an essential aspect of calibration. Refinement indicates separability of a network's correct and incorrect predictions. This paper presents a theoretically and empirically supported exposition reviewing refinement of a calibrated model. Firstly, we show the breakdown of expected calibration error (ECE), into predicted confidence and refinement under the assumption of over-confident predictions. Secondly, linking with this result, we highlight that regularization based calibration only focuses on naively reducing a model's confidence. This logically has a severe downside to a model's refinement as correct and incorrect predictions become tightly coupled. Lastly, connecting refinement with ECE also provides support to existing refinement based approaches which improve calibration but do not explain the reasoning behind it. We support our claims through rigorous empirical evaluations of many state of the art calibration approaches on widely used datasets and neural networks. We find that many calibration approaches with the likes of label smoothing, mixup etc. lower the usefulness of a DNN by degrading its refinement. Even under natural data shift, this calibration-refinement trade-off holds for the majority of calibration methods.",There is an error with the assumption of proof required for equation 8 in section 2.1 which invalidates the results,14

Such algorithms have been developed for multiple extensions of FO$^2$(the fragment of First Order Logic with two variables) for the special case of symmetric weight functions. In this paper, instead of developing a specific algorithm, we derive a closed form formula for WFOMC in FO$^2$. The three key advantages of our proposal are: (i) it deals with existential quantifiers without introducing negative weights; (ii) it easily extends to FO$^2$ with cardinality constraints and counting quantifiers (aka C$^2$); finally, (iii) it supports WFOMC for a class of weight functions strictly larger than symmetric weight functions, which can model count distributions, without introducing complex or negative weights.",Retracted due to an error in proof for WFOMC with counting quantifiers,15

More specifically, we focus on the design of compact name-independent fault-tolerant routing schemes, where the designer of the scheme is not allowed to assign names to nodes, i.e., the name of a node is just its identifier. Given a set $F$ of faulty (or forbidden) edges, the goal is to route from a source node $s$ to a target $t$ avoiding the forbidden edges in $F$. Given any name-dependent fault-tolerant routing scheme and any name-independent routing scheme, we show how to use them as a black box to construct a name-independent fault-tolerant routing scheme. In particular, we present a name-independent routing scheme able to handle any set $F$ of forbidden edges in $|F|+1$ connected graphs. This has stretch $O(k^2\,|F|^3(|F|+\log^2 n)\log D)$, where $D$ is the diameter of the graph. It uses tables of size $ \widetilde{O}(k\, n^{1/k}(k + deg(v)))$ bits at every node $v$, where $deg(v)$ is the degree of node $v$. In the context of networks that suffer only from occasional failures, we present a name-independent routing scheme that handles only $1$ fault at a time, and another routing scheme that handles at most $2$ faults at a time. The former uses $\widetilde{O}(k^2\, n^{1/k} + k\,deg(v))$ bits of memory per node, with stretch $O(k^3\log D)$.

To satisfy this demand, we propose two resource allocation (RA) algorithms to optimize the place of social media in the cache of the Base stations (BSs) and radio resources (i.e., transmit powers and subcarriers), jointly in a multi-cell Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) based system. In the first scheme, the total downloading delay of the network is minimized, while in the second scheme, a fairness-aware scheme is proposed in which the maximum downloading delays is minimized. We propose iterative algorithms to solve each problem, where the content placement problem and the joint subcarrier and transmit power allocation problem will be iteratively optimized. We also prove that the proposed approaches converges to a near-optimal solution, as well as the number of iterations increases.","We decide to upgrade this version to a high quality version with a better structure. We found a problem in the time scale of two separated phases known as caching phase and delivery phase. Therefore, We should not jointly optimize the content placement and radio resources",19

Thus, different areas of steganography turn to one of the most challengeable topics of current researches. In this paper a novel method is presented to hide an image into the host image and Hardware/Software design is proposed to implement our stagenography system on FPGA- DE2 70 Altera board. The size of the secret image is quadrant of the host image. Host image works as a cipher key to completely distort and encrypt the secret image using XOR operand. Each pixel of the secret image is composed of 8 bits (4 bit-pair) in which each bit-pair is distorted by XORing it with two LSB bits of the host image and putting the results in the location of two LSB bits of host image. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to the most recently proposed algorithms by considering that the obtained information entropy for encrypt image is approximately equal to 8.",please withdraw this paper because of crucial equation error in Table 1,15

Problems quantizing general relativity because it is not renormalizable have led to a search for a new theory of gravity that, while still agreeing with measured observations, is renormalizable. In this paper, I show that, given a ""vortex"" model of elementary particles in which rest mass derives from intrinsic spin and polarization, a Yang-Mills force with a SO(4,1) group symmetry predicts post-Newtonian N-body motion such as solar system observations of gravitational behavior as well as binary pulsar precession and orbital speed-up caused by gravitational radiation-reaction. Yang-Mills theory of the SO(4,1) group is defined on a lattice graph such that a background manifold is not required-a property unique to the (anti-) de Sitter and Poincar_ groups. It predicts the accelerating expansion of the universe as a consequence of the de Sitter group Lie algebra-an acceleration that I show does not occur in the Poincar_ group approximation-suggesting that the de Sitter group symmetry explains dark energy.

1311.7225v2,1311.7225v1,Information Theory (cs.IT),Link Quality Control Mechanism for Selective and Opportunistic AF Relaying in Cooperative ARQs: A MLSD Perspective,"Incorporating relaying techniques into Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ) mechanisms gives a general impression of diversity and throughput enhancements. Allowing overhearing among multiple relays is also a known approach to increase the number of participating relays in ARQs. However, when opportunistic amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying is applied to cooperative ARQs, the system design becomes nontrivial and even involved. Based on outage analysis, the spatial and temporal diversities are first found sensitive to the received signal qualities of relays, and a link quality control mechanism is then developed to prescreen candidate relays in order to explore the diversity of cooperative ARQs with a selective and opportunistic AF (SOAF) relaying method. According to the analysis, the temporal and spatial diversities can be fully exploited if proper thresholds are set for each hop along the relaying routes. The SOAF relaying method is further examined from a packet delivery viewpoint. By the principle of the maximum likelihood sequence detection (MLSD), sufficient conditions on the link quality are established for the proposed SOAF-relaying-based ARQ scheme to attain its potential diversity order in the packet error rates (PERs) of MLSD. The conditions depend on the minimum codeword distance and the average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Furthermore, from a heuristic viewpoint, we also develop a threshold searching algorithm for the proposed SOAF relaying and link quality method to exploit both the diversity and the SNR gains in PER. The effectiveness of the proposed thresholding mechanism is verified via simulations with trellis codes.","This paper has been withdrawn by the authors due to an improper proof for Theorem 2.

2211.08215v2,2211.08215v1,Optimization and Control (math.OC),Superlinear convergence of an infeasible interior point algorithm on the homogeneous feasibility model of a semi-definite program,"In the literature, superlinear convergence of implementable polynomial-time interior point algorithms to solve semi-definite programs (SDPs) can only be shown by (i) assuming that the given SDP is nondegenerate and modifying these algorithms, or (ii) considering special classes of SDPs, such as the class of linear semi-definite feasibility problems, when a suitable initial iterate is required as well. Otherwise, these algorithms are not easy to implement even though they can be shown to have polynomial iteration complexities and superlinear convergence. These are besides the assumption of strict complementarity imposed on the given SDP. In this paper, we show superlinear convergence of an implementable interior point algorithm that has polynomial iteration complexity when it is used to solve the homogeneous feasibility model of a primal-dual SDP pair that has no special structure imposed. This is achieved by only assuming strict complementarity and the availability of an interior feasible point to the primal SDP. Furthermore, we do not need to modify the algorithm to show this.","This preprint contains a major error in that Proposition 3.1 in it is wrong, and this affects the main result in the preprint",17

Although positive observers have been designed for positive systems, they are unable to estimate the states when unknown inputs or disturbances are present in the systems. This paper is a first attempt to design positive unknown input observers (PUIO) for positive linear systems. The structural constraints on observer parameters make the design task cumbersome. However, with the aid of a positive stabilization scheme via LMI and by imposing conditions on positivity of the generalized inverse associated with a certain design matrix, we provide a reliable procedure for the design of PUIOs.",This paper has been withdrawn by the authors due to errors in equation 25 and 33,6
2106.11551v2,2106.11551v1,Optimization and Control (math.OC),Optimization of bus scheduling and bus-berth matching at curbside stops under connected vehicle environment,It is commonly seen that buses are blocked by the ones in front serving passengers and have to queue outside a curbside bus stop although there are vacant berths at the stop. The resultant bus delays degrade the service level of urban public transportation. A potential solution is to reschedule the arrivals of the buses at the stop for full utilization of the berths with the aid of connected vehicle technologies. This study proposes a mixed-integer linear programming model to optimize the scheduling of bus arrivals and the bus-berth matching at a curbside stop under connected vehicle environment. The objective is the minimization of the bus delays weighted by the number of passengers on the buses. Bus arrival times at the stop and the assignment of berths are optimized together with bus departure times from the stop. Bus punctuality is also taken into consideration. The proposed model could be applied dynamically to cater to time-varying traffic conditions. Numerical studies validate the advantages of the proposed model over the first-come-first-service strategy and the relaxed model without bus punctuality in terms of weighted bus delays and bus punctuality. Sensitivity analyses show that: 1) the proposed model is robust to the fluctuation of bus service time; and 2) a smaller number of berths may be preferred on condition that the bus demand does not exceed the stop capacity.,The results in Figure 6 are not completely consistant with the results in Table 4. The delay is only several seconds and M2 is overestimated. More experimetns is needed to validate the proposed model,30

In this work we explore the non-linear dynamics of those modes in a conformal fluid. Among all possible SOTs, we choose to work with the Divergence Type Theories (DTT) formalism, which ensures that the second law of thermodynamics is satisfied non-perturbatively. In considering a perturbative scheme within this formalism, at next to leading order a set of Maxwell-Cattaneo equations is obtained, as in e.g. Israel-Stewart theories. The tensor modes include two divergence-free modes which have no analog in theories based on covariant Navier-Stokes equations, and that are particularly relevant because they may couple linearly to a gravitational field. To study the dynamics of this irreducible tensor sector, we observe that in causal theories such as DTTs, thermal fluctuations induce a stochastic stirring force in the equations of motion, which excites the tensor modes while preserving energy momentum conservation. From fluctuation-dissipation considerations, it follows that the random force is Gaussian with a white spectrum. The irreducible tensor modes in turn excite vector modes, which back-react on the tensor sector, thus producing a consistent non-linear, second order description of the divergence-free tensor dynamics. Using the Martin-Siggia-Rose (MSR) formalism we obtain the two-point correlation function for these tensor modes at next to leading order, and the induced stochastic component of the energy-momentum tensor. We find that the thermal fluctuations induce a scale invariant spectrum at short scales, while preserving a white spectrum at large scales. This result suggests that tensor modes could sustain an entropy cascade.",This manuscript was withdrawn because the perturbative analysis of Section 3 had severe inconsistencies that lead to a wrong result,34

The result shows that machine learning as a modern method far surpasses traditional models in precision.","The successful result can be greatly attributed to overfitting.

Explicit values of the bounds for forms of degrees 5 and higher are not yet known. The main result of this article is the construction of explicit such bounds, for all degrees d, which behave like power towers of height d^3/6+11d/6-4. This is done by establishing a bound D(k,d), which controls the number of generators of a minimal prime over an ideal of a regular sequence of k or fewer forms of degree d, and supplementing it into Ananyan and Hochster's proof in order to obtain a recurrence relation.","A critical mistake was made at the end of section 4.

Here we show a new possibility that the axion can be induced by a pseudo Goldstone seesaw mechanism although the Peccei-Quinn symmetry is exactly forbidden. Specifically, after the spontaneous breaking of appropriate gauge and discrete symmetries, a heavy pseudo Goldstone coupling to colored fermions is allowed to have a tiny mass mixing with an ultralight pseudo Goldstone.

These games include two players - a defender, an attacker, and a set of targets. The key practical elements are that (i) the attacker can simultaneously attack multiple targets, and (ii) different targets exhibits various types of dependency, which depends on the applications being protected (e.g., protection of critical infrastructure IT and supply chain network security, etc.). However, previous models and algorithms fail to scale up and little is known of the computational complexity of these problem, especially when there exist dependencies between targets. In this paper, we investigate a general security game where the utility function is defined on a collection of subsets of all targets, and we provide a novel theoretical framework to show how to compactly represent such game, efficiently compute the optimal (minimax) strategies and characterize the complexity of this problem. We apply our theoretical framework to the \emph{network security game}.

In particular, repeated sampling from constrained distributions is a common task in Bayesian inferential methods, where coping with these constraints can cause troublesome computational burden. Here, we introduce computationally efficient methods to make exact and independent draws from both the multivariate normal and Wishart distributions with box constraints. In both cases, these variables are sampled using a direct algorithm. By substantially reducing computing time, these new algorithms improve the feasibility of Monte Carlo-based inference for box-constrained, multivariate normal and Wishart distributions.","There is an error in the the technical proofs for the proposed algorithms' validity.

Landsman in the book ""Mathematical Topics between Classical and Quantum Mechanics"" (1998) and the dynamical formulation of the Einstein's equation, and to clarify how from the relevant groupoid the Poisson bracket between constraints of the hamiltonian formulation emerges as an algebroid bracket. To do so, we adapt the groupoid proposed by C. Blohmann, M. Fernandes and A. Weinstein in the paper ""Groupoid symmetry and constraints in General Relativity"" (2010) by using a different, in our view simpler and more natural, diffeological structure. As a result, we get a different algebroid associated to it, such that the algebroid bundle can be understood as a configuration space of the dynamical formulation of General Relativity, the bracket structure between its sections being of the desired form. We point out the conceptual advantages of this perspective, as well as some interesting issues that require further investigation.

This method makes use of deformations of the unit cell only at the ferromagnetic state. Hence, it does not require the difficult first-principles calculation of the equilibrium volume at the paramagnetic state. To validate this methodology, we apply it to body-centered cubic Fe and face-centered cubic Ni single crystals, finding consistent results with experiment and previous first-principles calculations. The simplicity and reliability of this approach could be exploited in the high-throughput screening of spontaneous volume magnetostriction, as well as associated quantities like isotropic magnetoelastic constants and isotropic magnetostrictive coefficients.","To compute spontaneous volume magnetostriction with the described method, the volume of the reference unit cell (unstrained state), from which the deformations are generated, should be equal to the equilibrium volume of the paramagnetic state.

High-field inductively-detected Ga-71 NMR was performed with samples immersed in superfluid He to investigate the effects of continuous-wave near band-edge optical illumination on lattice nuclear spins in the ferromagnetic phase. The photon energy dependence of the light-induced NMR signals for GaAs and the GaMnAs film samples were recorded using circularly polarized light. Interpretation of the data was guided by electronic band structure calculations using the k.p method in the presence of an external magnetic field using the modified 8-band Pidgeon-Brown model. The photon energy dependence of the NMR transition intensity exhibited a shift of the absorption band edge; invariance with respect to the sense of helicity of the exciting light; and an absence of oscillations in the photon energy dependence, all of which are consistent with theoretical predictions. The dynamics of the optically activated NMR experiments was investigated by variable optical intensity studies and light/dark modulated optical pumping experiments. This is because doping with Mn (a p-type dopant) can push the Fermi level deep into the valence bands and block the optical transitions (Burstein-Moss effect) needed to create spin polarized electrons. Additionally, the calculated enhancement of the conduction electron g-factor by over two orders of magnitude is expected to quench the electron-nuclear spin angular moment transfer, which impedes the hyperpolarization of lattice nuclei. Experiments with variable light intensity and optical gating reveal a mechanism consistent with light-induced quadrupolar relaxation, a process that will certainly interfere with the optical transfer and storage of quantum information in the lattice nuclear spin states in this material.","Assignment of the experimental optically pumped NMR signals to the Ga(Mn)As film layer, as reported in this manuscript, is probably incorrect and a revised interpretation is currently under consideration",33

As a result, a general scalable implementation of this model in the DNA computing paradigm is presented and can be generalized to the application of \emph{all} fast matrix multiplication algorithms on a DNA computer. Fast methods of matrix computations with DNA are important because they also allow for the efficient implementation of other algorithms (i.e. inversion, computing determinants, and graph theory) on a DNA computer.","This paper has been withdrawn for the time being by the author because it has been shown that the use of bio-molecular operations suggested by the Adleman-Lipton model is not very reliable in practice. The massive ligation step cannot produce longer molecules (certainly not more than 10-15 ligations in a row), both the complexity of the tube content and the efficiency of the enzyme are obscuring the results. The streptavidin based separations, as used by Adleman's initial experiment, are also with questionable success when applied to a complex test tube. So, at least the operations ""Annealing(T)"" and ""Separation(T1,X, T2)"" proposed in the paper cannot be used reliably (even less when recursion is needed). Thus, until this issue is resolved, the algorithm presented cannot work in practice, yet does have some theoretical use to it. If the pseudocode is more standardized and made more clear, the paper can be viewed as a theoretical exercise showing how using residue number system to represent numbers and parallel algorithms could improve the complexity of solving matrix multiplication.

The ""measurement state"" or ""Schrodinger's cat state"" of a superposed quantum system and its detector is nonlocally entangled, suggesting that we turn to nonlocality experiments for insight into measurements. By studying the full range of superposition phases, these experiments show precisely what the measurement state does and does not superpose. These experiments reveal that the measurement state is not, as had been supposed, a paradoxical superposition of detector states. It is instead a nonparadoxical superposition of two correlations between detector states and system states. In this way, the experimental results resolve the problem of definite outcomes (""Schrodinger's cat""), leading to a resolution of the measurement problem. However, this argument does not yet resolve the measurement problem because it is based on the results of experiments, while measurement is a theoretical problem: How can standard quantum theory explain the definite outcomes seen experimentally? Thus, we summarize the nonlocality experiments' supporting theory, which rigorously predicts the experimental results directly from optical paths.

Because it avoids reduced density operators, the optical-path analysis is immune to such criticism.",An error occurs in Section 5.

2110.08504v2,2110.08504v1,Quantum Physics (quant-ph),The rationality about the assumption that the signal and decoy states are indistinguishable in decoy-state quantum key distribution,"Decoy-state quantum key distribution (QKD) has become the most efficient method to resist the photon-number-splitting (PNS) attack and estimate the secure key rate. The decoy-state method has many assumptions, among which a critical one is that an eavesdropper (Eve) cannot distinguish between the signal and decoy states. However, a rigorous proof of the rationality about this assumption is not yet available so far. In fact, due to the difference of photon-number probability distribution between the signal and decoy states, Eve is able to distinguish the two states with a certain probability. In this work, we adopt the Bayesian decision to distinguish the signal and decoy states in one-decoy-state QKD, and perform different PNS attack strategies for the two states according to the previous decision. The numerical simulations indicate that the attack effect is not obvious or even failed. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that the signal and decoy states are indistinguishable in decoy-state QKD. In addition, we also provide the method to set the intensities of signal and decoy states properly, which can not only reduce the preparation cost and improve the communication efficiency, but also avoid the attack from Eve using the intensity difference between the signal and decoy states.","Even Eve can distinguish signal state from decoy state by the Bayesian decision, the yield of signal state and decoy state is still the same only if the photon number is the same.

The several variable theorem proved here characterizes several variable operator monotone functions, not assumed to be (free) analytic, as real functions that admit (free) analytic continuation mapping the upper operator polyhalf-space into the upper operator half-space over an arbitrary Hilbert space. During the process we establish a new integral formula for them over the standard simplex based on the Krein-Milman theorem. The formula represents operator monotone functions as the closure of convex combinations of weighted harmonic means. We prove that such functions are completely determined by its values at tuples of positive scalars. The results then are applied to the theory of multivariable operator means.

Here we consider a circuit where the path from the source of electric current to the drain necessarily passes through a segment consisting solely of neutral modes.

Thus, neutral modes carry information that can be used to nonlocally reconstruct a dc charge current.

In the case of either handedness, the pertinent spinor field equation arises directly from a suitable form of the world Bianchi identity. It appears that each such field equation bears a term that is thought of as carrying part of the information on the mass of the fields.

Next to the requirement that certain components of the Einstein tensor - resp. the stress-energy tensor - be zero, the main prerequisite for bringing the MOTS operator into the required form is the existence of a non-expanding null horizon together with a set of eigenfunctions of the MOTS operator that does not change along the Lie flow of the generator of said horizon.

This method completely avoids the problems of PMMA-residue and possible PMMA coating induced tear-off by harnessing hydrophobic-hydrophobic interactions between graphene and UHMWPE, which is one of most facile and cheapest transfer methods that are currently available, especially for large-area graphene preparation and transfer. Multi-layer sandwich structure composite membrane of graphene and UHMWPE with desired number of layers can also be easily prepared by repeating the transfer method. The most significant applications of this transfer method lie on that it facilitates thin polymer membranes the possibilities to be directly observed with high magnification by electron microscopes, such as SEM and TEM. Thus the crystallization and phase-behavior of polymers including UHMWPE can be investigated with real-time and in-situ morphological observations, even in the presence of their solvent and with the need of thermal treatment.

Because of the less strenuous constraints imposed by s-LHV models, we were able to derive a contingent Bell inequality in analogy to the CHSH inequality, but which does not require bounding of measurement statistics. Following this, we show by explicit example that there are cases of states that rule out s-LHV models by violating our inequality, but which nonetheless have a multivariate LHV model. Even so, we show how merely ruling out s-LHV models is still sufficient to allow for fully device independent quantum key distribution (QKD) and entanglement witnessing. This being the case, our inequality illustrates two things. First, it makes fully device-independent QKD on continuous variables substantially more straightforward. Second, it shows how the degree of correlation needed to demonstrate device-independent QKD is distinct from both Bell-nonlocality and EPR-steering. Although nonlocality in general requires ruling out all LHV models, s-LHV models are sufficiently useful to warrant further exploration.",This paper has been withdrawn due to a counterexample invalidating equation 7 as a universal constraint on LHV models using a single hidden variable.,6

Our neural model for joint word segmentation and part-of-speech tagging has the architecture of the syllable-based CRF constituency parser. To reduce the complexity of parsing, we replace all constituent labels with a single label indicating for phrases. This model can be augmented with predicted word boundary and part-of-speech tags by other tools. Because Vietnamese and Chinese have some similar linguistic phenomena, we evaluated the proposed model and its augmented versions on three Vietnamese benchmark datasets and six Chinese benchmark datasets.

K-means++ tries to address the problem by seeding the means using a distance-based sampling scheme. However, seeding the means in K-means++ needs $O\left(K\right)$ sequential passes through the entire dataset, and this can be very costly for large datasets. Here we propose a method of seeding the initial means based on factorizations of higher order moments for bounded data. Our method takes $O\left(1\right)$ passes through the entire dataset to extract the initial set of means, and its final cost can be proven to be within $O(\sqrt{K})$ of the optimal cost.

Additionally, given an underlying true manifold $\cM$, we show that the Hausdorff distance between $\cR(f\circ p)$ and its projection onto $\cM$ is smaller than the Hausdorff distance between $\cR(p)$ and the corresponding projection. This motivates us to apply an increasing and concave transformation before the ridge estimation. In specific, we show that the power transformations $f^{q}(y)=y^q/q,-\infty<q\leq 1$ are increasing and concave on $\RR_+$, and thus we can use such power transformations when $p$ is strictly positive.

The solution domain considered is a bounded smooth doubly connected planar domain bounded by two simple disjoint closed curves. The analysis of the problem is based on the indirect integral equations method. The solution is represented as a sum of two single-layer potentials defined on each of the two boundary curves with unknown densities. To find out the densities the representation is matched with the given Robin data to generate a system of linear integral equations of the second kind with continuous and weakly-singular kernels. It is shown that the operator corresponding to this system is injective and due to its compactness according to Riesz theory there exists a unique solution. To discretize the system we apply Nystrom method with a specifically chosen quadrature rules to obtain an exponential order of convergence of the approximate solution.

In optics, the real time imaging requires the reconstruction of an object by the samples of Radon transform at a \emph{single angle} (SA). Driven by this and motivated by the connection between Bin Han's construction of wavelet frames (e.g \cite{Han1}) and Radon transform, in refinableshift-invariant spaces (SISs) we investigate the SA-Radon sample based reconstruction problem. We have two main theorems. The fist main theorem states that, any compactly supported function in a SIS generated by a general refinable function can be determined by its Radon samples at the designed angle. Motivated by the extensive application of positive definite (PD) functions to interpolation of scattered data, we also investigate the SA reconstruction problem in a class of (refinable) box-spline generated SISs. Thanks to the PD property of the Radon transform of such spline, our second main theorem states that, the reconstruction of compactly supported functions in these spline generated SISs can be achieved by the Radon samples at a \emph{generic angle}.

This paper generalizes that method to deal with not only a large class of Collatz-type maps defined on the integers, but further generalizations thereof to Collatz-type maps on the rings of integers on an arbitrary algebraic number field.","Withdrawn due to an error in section three, where the structure of the quotient of a ring of algebraic integers modulo an ideal thereof was incorrectly described",27
2403.18567v2,2403.18567v1,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),The effect of Relativistic Aberration on Cosmological Distances,"Aims: we propose that the condition of relative motion between us and the objects that we observe in the Universe should generate relativistic aberration on the photons that such objects emit, varying the observed flux similarly to the cases of blazars and neutron stars, with instead a decrease of this radiative flux. Methods: we follow some important papers and textbook used in modern cosmology, adding the effects of relativistic aberration in the theoretical description of the Cosmos. Results: New definitions for the luminosity distance and the angular distance arise, with the consequence of changing the cosmological parameters measured in the last years. A qualitative description of all of this is also performed on the multipole analysis of the CMB.","the paper is based on the false assumption that galaxies are in a different reference frame in which we are, and this error is present in the ""computations"" section of the paper. Following this, all the results presented are wrong",9
1710.07764v3,1710.07764v2,Mathematical Physics (math-ph),A connection between the Kontsevich-Witten and Brezin-Gross-Witten tau-functions,"The Brezin-Gross-Witten model is one of the basic examples in the class of non-eigenvalue unitary matrix models. In the Kontsevich phase, it is a tau-function for the KdV hierarchy. In this paper we present an explicit formula that connects the Kontsevich-Witten and Brezin-Gross-Witten tau-functions using the $\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}_2}$ operators, which preserves the KdV integrability. The differential operators used in the formula are simply the Virasoro and Heisenberg operators. While the geometric interpretation of the Brezin-Gross-Witten model remains unknown, the formula provides a possible way to identify this model with enumerative geometry invariants.",The description about the differential operators \hat{L}_{2m} being sl_2 operators is incorrect in Section 2.1,26
0909.1823v2,0909.1823v1,Probability (math.PR),Weak Approximations for Wiener functionals,"In this paper we introduce a simple space-filtration discretization scheme on Wiener space which allows us to study weak decompositions of a large class of Wiener functionals. We show that any Wiener functional has an underlying robust semimartingale skeleton which under mild conditions converges to it. The approximation is given in terms of discrete-jumping filtrations which allow us to approximate irregular processes by means of a stochastic derivative operator on Wiener space introduced in this work. As a by-product, we prove that continuous paths and a suitable notion of energy are sufficient in order to get a unique orthogonal decomposition similar to weak Dirichlet processes. In this direction, we generalize the main results given in Graversen and Rao and Coquet et al in the particular Brownian filtration case. The second part of this paper is devoted to the application of these abstract results to concrete irregular processes. We show that our embedded semimartingale structure allows a very explicit and sharp approximation scheme for densities of square-integrable Brownian martingales in full generality. In the last part, we provide new approximations for integrals w.r.t the Brownian local-time.",This paper has been withdrawn due to mistakes in Prop. 4.1 and Lemma 2.3,48
1704.08620v4,1704.08620v3,Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS),Improved approximation algorithm for the Dense-3-Subhypergraph Problem,"The study of Dense-$3$-Subhypergraph problem was initiated in Chlamt{_}c et al. [Approx'16]. The input is a universe $U$ and collection ${\cal S}$ of subsets of $U$, each of size $3$, and a number $k$. The goal is to choose a set $W$ of $k$ elements from the universe, and maximize the number of sets, $S\in {\cal S}$ so that $S\subseteq W$. The members in $U$ are called {\em vertices} and the sets of ${\cal S}$ are called the {\em hyperedges}. This is the simplest extension into hyperedges of the case of sets of size $2$ which is the well known Dense $k$-subgraph problem. The best known ratio for the Dense-$3$-Subhypergraph is $O(n^{0.69783..})$ by Chlamt{_}c et al. We improve this ratio to $n^{0.61802..}$. More importantly, we give a new algorithm that approximates Dense-$3$-Subhypergraph within a ratio of $\tilde O(n/k)$, which improves the ratio of $O(n^2/k^2)$ of Chlamt{_}c et al. We prove that under the {\em log density conjecture} (see Bhaskara et al. [STOC'10]) the ratio cannot be better than $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ and demonstrate some cases in which this optimum can be attained.",Claim 4.6 does not hold for the algorithm; we erroneously claimed that we could nullify kD'_i edges in the ith step of the algorithm,14
2201.01827v4,2201.01827v3,Theoretical Economics (econ.TH),Reputational Bargaining and Inefficient Technology Adoption,"A buyer and a seller bargain over the price of an object. Both players can build reputations for being obstinate by offering the same price over time. Before players bargain, the seller decides whether to adopt a new technology that can lower his cost of production. We show that even when the buyer cannot observe the seller's adoption decision, players' reputational incentives can lead to inefficient under-adoption and significant delays in reaching agreement, and that these inefficiencies arise in equilibrium if and only if the social benefit from adoption is large enough. As a result, an increase in the benefit from adoption may lower the probability of adoption.",We would like to withdraw the current submission since we just realized that a richness assumption on the space of commitment types is missing in our uniqueness result. We will resubmit once we have a new draft ready,43
1302.4830v2,1302.4830v1,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),The radiation energy component of the Hubble function and a LCDM cosmological simulation,"We study some effects the inclusion of the radiation energy component in the universe, Omega_r, can have on several quantities of interest for the large-scale structure of the universe in a LCDM cosmological simulation; started at a very high redshift (z=500). In particular we compute the power spectrum density, the halo mass function, and the concentration-mass relation for haloes. We find that Omega_r has an important contribution in the long-term nonlinear evolution of structures in the universe. For instance, a lower matter density power, by approx 50%, in all scales is obtained when compared with a simulation without the radiation term. Also, haloes formed with the Omega_r taken into account are approx 20% less concentrated than when not included in the Hubble function.",This paper has been withdrawn by the author due to the use an incorrect equation for perturbations including radiation. The linear part of the spectrum should follow the P(k),5
2308.07873v2,2308.07873v1,Computer Science and Game Theory (cs.GT),Near-Optimal Last-iterate Convergence of Policy Optimization in Zero-sum Polymatrix Markov games,"Computing approximate Nash equilibria in multi-player general-sum Markov games is a computationally intractable task. However, multi-player Markov games with certain cooperative or competitive structures might circumvent this intractability. In this paper, we focus on multi-player zero-sum polymatrix Markov games, where players interact in a pairwise fashion while remain overall competitive. To the best of our knowledge, we propose the first policy optimization algorithm called Entropy-Regularized Optimistic-Multiplicative-Weights-Update (ER-OMWU) for finding approximate Nash equilibria in finite-horizon zero-sum polymatrix Markov games with full information feedback. We provide last-iterate convergence guarantees for finding an $\epsilon$-approximate Nash equilibrium within $\tilde{O}(1/\epsilon)$ iterations, which is near-optimal compared to the optimal $O(1/\epsilon)$ iteration complexity in two-player zero-sum Markov games, which is a degenerate case of zero-sum polymatrix games with only two players involved. Our algorithm combines the regularized and optimistic learning dynamics with separated smooth value update within a single loop, where players update strategies in a symmetric and almost uncoupled manner. It provides a natural dynamics for finding equilibria and is more probable to be adapted to a sample-efficient and fully decentralized implementation where only partial information feedback is available in the future.","Proof of Lemma 3.4 is wrong, \bar{L}_{h+1}^{t-k} should be replaced by \sqrt{\bar{L}_{h+1}^{t-k}}. In this case the proof of the main theorem should be substantially modified",29
