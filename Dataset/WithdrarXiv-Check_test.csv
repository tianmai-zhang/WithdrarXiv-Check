2303.17613v10,2303.17613v9,"Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability (physics.data-an)",Principal Geodesic Analysis applied to climate time series,"Principal Geodesic Analysis (PGA) is applied to a climate time series. First, we transform each multidimensional sequence into the path signature. Since the signature lives in a curved space, usual principal component analysis (PCA) is not applicable. Instead, we treat the signature space as a geodesic manifold. By replacing the notion of straight lines with that of geodesics, the domain of PCA can be extended to the curved space. Then, the first principal component is derived as the geodesic that minimizes the unexplained variance in the data. As an application, we computed the leading modes for one-year NINO SST time series, which are divided into segments that represent annual variations of monthly averages. It is interesting that some months in a year reveal characteristic undulations that could indicate the early signs of upcoming El Nin_ events.","The theoretical structure, in particular the existence of the Riemannian metric, was flawed and will be resubmitted after reconsideration",23,TRUE
2103.13332v3,2103.13332v1,Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI),Truth and Subjunctive Theories of Knowledge: No Luck?,"The paper explores applications of Kripke's theory of truth to semantics for anti-luck epistemology, that is, to subjunctive theories of knowledge. Subjunctive theories put forward modal or subjunctive conditions to rule out knowledge by mere luck as to be found in Gettier-style counterexamples to the analysis of knowledge as justified true belief. Because of the subjunctive nature of these conditions the resulting semantics turns out to be non-monotone, even if it is based on non-classical evaluation schemes such as strong Kleene or FDE. This blocks the usual road to fixed-point results for Kripke's theory of truth within these semantics and consequently the paper is predominantly an exploration of fixed point results for Kripke's theory of truth within non-monotone semantics. Using the theory of quasi-inductive definitions we show that in case of the subjunctive theories of knowledge the so-called Kripke jump will have fixed points despite the non-monotonicity of the semantics: Kripke's theory of truth can be successfully applied in the framework of subjunctive theories of knowledge.","The notion of stabilizing ordinal is not well-defined, i.e., Definition 14 is flawed.

Its detailed structural and physical properties have been studied using x-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, magnetization, specific heat, and dielectric measurements. Rietveld analysis of the powder XRD data and transmission electron microscopy studies confirm that STMO is not a double perovskite structure with Fm-3m space group. But it is a disordered perovskite structure with Pm-3m space group where Ti4+ and Mn4+ ions are randomly distributed at the 1b site. The dc magnetization (\c{hi}dc-vs-T) measurements in the temperature range 2-300K reveals a single anomaly at ~13K with predominant long range canted antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering. The frequency invariant maxima at 13K in the ac susceptibility (\c{hi}ac-vs-T) discards the spin-glass behaviour in STMO. Despite the presence of sharp feature in M-T data, the specific heat data (Cp-vs-T) shows only a broad hump around 13K, which has been attributed to the magneto-structural ordering giving rise to canted AFM state in chemically disorder STMO. Matching with the magnetic and specific heat anomaly, the dielectric permittivity also shows a broad anomaly around 14K, indicating the possible magneto-dielectric coupling in STMO.",this paper has been withdrawn due to minor error in the calculation of dielectric constant,16,FALSE

The low energy regime of this interaction is often not considered rigorously in emissive sheath simulations, but may be modeled from quantum mechanical first principles, and has important applications to plasma thrusters and fusion devices. In this work, low energy electron reflection from the wall is implemented as a boundary condition in a continuum kinetic framework and the sheath is simulated for dielectric material parameters in high and low emission cases. The results presented here demonstrate that the material parameters can have significant effect on the resulting sheath profile and particle distribution functions. Surfaces with high reflection rates see the formation of a space-charge limited sheath.","Error in formulation of Bronold-Fehske model.

The acquired data in FROG, called FROG trace, is the Fourier magnitude of the product of the unknown pulse with a time-shifted version of itself, for several different shifts. To estimate the pulse from the FROG trace, we propose an algorithm that minimizes a smoothed non-convex least-squares objective function. The method consists of two steps. First, we approximate the pulse by an iterative spectral algorithm. Then, the attained initialization is refined based upon a sequence of block stochastic gradient iterations. The overall algorithm is conceptually simple, numerically scalable, and easy-to-implement. Empirically, our approach outperforms all competitive alternatives under noiseless and noisy scenarios, and when the FROG trace is incomplete, that is, when only few shifts are recorded. In addition, we prove that in the vicinity of the true solution, the algorithm converges to a critical point.

The authors claimed that a new body-centered tetragonal carbon allotrope with I4/mmm symmetry, termed bct-C40, can host this novel state exhibiting boxed-astrisk shaped nodal nets.

Unarguably, the technology itself can revolutionize the way we live our everyday life. But the exponential growth of technology poses a daunting task for policy researchers and law makers in making amendments to the existing norms. In addition, not everyone in the society is studying the potential socio-economic intricacies and cultural drifts that AI can bring about. It is prudence to reflect from our historical past to propel the development of technology in the right direction. To benefit the society of the present and future, I scientifically explore the societal impact of AI. While there are many public and private partnerships working on similar aspects, here I describe the necessity for an Unanimous International Regulatory Body for all applications of AI (UIRB-AI). I also discuss the benefits and drawbacks of such an organization. To combat any drawbacks in the formation of an UIRB-AI, both idealistic and pragmatic perspectives are discussed alternatively. The paper further advances the discussion by proposing novel policies on how such organization should be structured and how it can bring about a win-win situation for everyone in the society.","Based on the numerous reviews I have received, the figures illustrated in the paper are highly incorrect and vague.

2110.09901v3,2110.09901v2,Optimization and Control (math.OC),A FPTAS for the Subset Sum Problem with Real Numbers,"In this paper we study the subset sum problem with real numbers. Starting from the given problem, we formulate a quadratic maximization problem over a polytope which is eventually written as a distance maximization to a fixed point. For solving this, we provide a polynomial algorithm which maximizes the distance to a fixed point over a certain convex set. This convex set is obtained by intersecting the unit hypercube with two relevant half spaces. We show that in case the subset sum problem has a solution, our algorithm gives the correct maximum distance up to an arbitrary chosen precision. In such a case, we show that the obtained maximizer is a solution to the subset sum problem. Therefore, we compute the maximizer and upon analyzing it we can assert the feasibility of the subset sum problem.","It relies on maximizing the distance over an intersection of balls to a given point.

One natural problem is to understand the density $u(t,x)$ of the roots of the $(t\cdot n)-$th derivative of $p_n$ where $0 < t < 1$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$. We derive an \textit{infinite} number of conversation laws for the evolution of $u(t,x)$. The first three are \begin{align*} \int_{\mathbb{R}}{ u(t,x) ~ dx} = 1-t, \qquad \qquad \int_{\mathbb{R}}{ u(t,x) x ~ dx} = \left(1-t\right)\int_{\mathbb{R}}{ u(0,x) x~ dx}, \qquad \int_{\mathbb{R}} \int_{\mathbb{R}} u(t,x) (x-y)^2 u(t,y) ~ dx dy = (1-t)^3 \int_{\mathbb{R}} \int_{\mathbb{R}} u(0,x) (x-y)^2 u(0,y) ~ dx dy. \end{align*} The author suggested that $u(t,x)$ might evolve according to a nonlocal evolution equation involving the Hilbert transform; this has been verified for two special closed form solutions -- these conservation laws thus point to interesting identities for the Hilbert transform. We discuss many open problems.","This paper is withdrawn because there is an error in the last section: the algebraic identities, in the limit n-> \infty, all collapse to the first conservation law.

2005.08379v2,2005.08379v1,Social and Information Networks (cs.SI),Towards Characterizing the COVID-19 Awareness on Twitter,"The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has significantly altered our lifestyles as we resort to minimize the spread through preventive measures such as social distancing and quarantine. An increasingly worrying aspect is the gap between the exponential disease spread and the delay in adopting preventive measures. This gap is attributed to the lack of awareness about the disease and its preventive measures. Nowadays, social media platforms (ie., Twitter) are frequently used to create awareness about major events, including COVID-19. In this paper, we use Twitter to characterize public awareness regarding COVID-19 by analyzing the information flow in the most affected countries. Towards that, we collect more than 46K trends and 622 Million tweets from the top twenty most affected countries to examine 1) the temporal evolution of COVID-19 related trends, 2) the volume of tweets and recurring topics in those trends, and 3) the user sentiment towards preventive measures. Our results show that countries with a lower pandemic spread generated a higher volume of trends and tweets to expedite the information flow and contribute to public awareness. We also observed that in those countries, the COVID-19 related trends were generated before the sharp increase in the number of cases, indicating a preemptive attempt to notify users about the potential threat. Finally, we noticed that in countries with a lower spread, users had a positive sentiment towards COVID-19 preventive measures. Our measurements and analysis show that effective social media usage can influence public behavior, which can be leveraged to better combat future pandemics.",Figure 1 is incorrect.

However, it is challenging for users to discern whether the responses are generated with certainty or are fabricated to meet user expectations. Estimating the uncertainty of LLMs is particularly challenging due to their vast scale and the lack of white-box access. In this work, we propose a novel Uncertainty Tripartite Testing Paradigm (Unc-TTP) to classify LLM uncertainty, via evaluating the consistency of LLM outputs when incorporating label interference into the sampling-based approach. Based on Unc-TTP outputs, we aggregate instances into certain and uncertain categories. Further, we conduct a detailed analysis of the uncertainty properties of LLMs and show Unc-TTP's superiority over the existing sampling-based methods. In addition, we leverage the obtained uncertainty information to guide in-context example selection, demonstrating that Unc-TTP obviously outperforms retrieval-based and sampling-based approaches in selecting more informative examples. Our work paves a new way to classify the uncertainty of both open- and closed-source LLMs, and introduces a practical approach to exploit this uncertainty to improve LLMs performance.","The model diagram in Figure 1 on page 3 of the paper has significant ambiguities.

In this paper we study synchronization of phase oscillators on the most basic example of such a network, namely, the hierarchical lattice. Each oscillator has a natural frequency, drawn independently from a common probability distribution. In addition, pairs of oscillators interact with each other at a strength that depends on their hierarchical distance, modulated by a sequence of interaction parameters. We look at block averages of the oscillators on successive hierarchical scales, which we think of as block communities. Also these block communities are given a natural frequency, drawn independently from a common probability distribution that depends on their hierarchical scale. In the limit as the number of oscillators per community tends to infinity, referred to as the hierarchical mean-field limit, we find a separation of time scales, i.e., each block community behaves like a single oscillator evolving on its own time scale. We show that the evolution of the block communities is given by a renormalized mean-field noisy Kuramoto equation, with a synchronization level that depends on the hierarchical scale of the block community. We identify three universality classes for the synchronization levels on successive hierarchical scales, with explicit characterizations in terms of the sequence of interaction parameters and the sequence of natural frequency probability distributions. We show that disorder reduces synchronization when the natural frequency probability distributions are symmetric and unimodal, with the reduction gradually vanishing as the hierarchical scale goes up.","Error in the diffusion constant of Theorem 2.2, equation (2.4) due to a delicate issue in the method of the proof which is not trivial to correct",33,TRUE

Since there is some bilinear term in (YMH), which is a lack of null structure, one may obtain the well-posedness at most the energy space. However, we attain the scaling critical regularity of (YMH) by imposing the extra weighted regularity in the angular variables. In (YMD), for the coupled system to persist in time, it is required to impose the angular regularity on the Dirac spinor as much as the Yang-Mills gauge potential and curvature. We can then prove the scaling critical regularity of (YMD) using angular regularity instead of the null structure of the spinor field. In this manner, we present an approach to attack the scaling critical regularity of (YMH) and (YMD) simultaneously.

The primary approaches involve transferring text-video pairs to a common embedding space and leveraging cross-modal interactions on specific entities for semantic alignment. Though effective, these paradigms entail prohibitive computational costs, leading to inefficient retrieval. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective method, Global-Local Semantic Consistent Learning (GLSCL), which capitalizes on latent shared semantics across modalities for text-video retrieval. Specifically, we introduce a parameter-free global interaction module to explore coarse-grained alignment. Then, we devise a shared local interaction module that employs several learnable queries to capture latent semantic concepts for learning fine-grained alignment. Furthermore, an Inter-Consistency Loss (ICL) is devised to accomplish the concept alignment between the visual query and corresponding textual query, and an Intra-Diversity Loss (IDL) is developed to repulse the distribution within visual (textual) queries to generate more discriminative concepts. Extensive experiments on five widely used benchmarks (i.e., MSR-VTT, MSVD, DiDeMo, LSMDC, and ActivityNet) substantiate the superior effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. Remarkably, our method achieves comparable performance with SOTA as well as being nearly 220 times faster in terms of computational cost.

Finally, we present an elementary proof that the discriminant of the splitting field of a monic irreducible polynomial with integer coefficients has a computable upper bound in terms of the coefficients. This result, combined with one of Lagarias et al., shows that tests of polynomials for the cycle types of the Galois group are conclusive.

Several recent works design fixed-parameter algorithms for $N$-fold IPs by taking as parameters the numbers of rows and columns of the $A$- and $B$-matrices, together with the largest absolute value $\Delta$ over their entries. These advances provide fast algorithms for several well-studied combinatorial optimization problems on strings, on graphs, and in machine scheduling. In this work, we extend this research by proposing algorithms that additionally harness a partition structure of submatrices $A^{(i)}$ and $B^{(j)}$, where row indices of non-zero entries do not overlap between any two sets in the partition. Our main result is an algorithm for solving any $N$-fold IP in time $nt log(nt)L^2(S_A)^{O(r+s)}(p_Ap_B\Delta)^{O(rp_Ap_B+sp_Ap_B)}$, where $p_A$ and $p_B$ are the size of the largest set in such a partition of $A^{(i)}$ and $B^{(j)}$, respectively, $S_A$ is the number of parts in the partition of $A = (A^{(1)},..., A^{(n)}), and $L = (log(||u - \ell||_\infty)\cdot (log(max_{x:\ell \leq x \leq u} |c^Tx|))$ is a measure of the input.

Using the simplest quantum channel model consistent with neuronal membrane voltage-clamp experiments, activation eigenenergies are calculated for the Hodgkin-Huxley K+ and Na+ ion channels.

Then we count left ideals of $A$ and thereby determine the GCR for all nilpotent $\mathbb{F}_p$-algebras of dimension 4, and also show that for a set of $\mathbb{F}_p$-algebras of arbitrary dimension $n$ and exponent $e$, the GCR approaches 0 for large $p$, $n$ or $e$.","Theorem 1 is false for A = F_2[x]/(x^3): (A, +) \cong C_2 x C_2; (A, \circ) \cong C_4",11,TRUE

Pulse lengths both longer and shorter than the plasma wavelength are considered. It is turned out that the system shows adiabatic behavior as long as the plasma evolves very slowly in the Pulse Co-Moving (PCM) frame due to the ignorable radiation back-reactions. A sophisticated treatment of the adiabatic regime is presented, based on the proper application of the local conservation laws in the PCM frame in conjunction with the Lorentz transformations. In this context, equations for the overall pulse evolutions are reduced into a single equation in terms of the global pulse group-velocity. Due to the proven equality between the local phase velocities of the plasma wave and the radiation, anomalies are observed in this regime, in the global group velocity and the plasma dispersion. The group velocity shows non-explicit density dependency and of remaining above the linear value over a long period of the propagation. These results are successfully examined against PIC simulations and their consistency with the other system evolutions and the physical intuition is fully discussed. Afterward, the interaction locality is examined in terms of the plasma dispersion and the resultant spectral evolutions. And it is found that for pulse lengths larger than the plasma wavelength, the plasma-wave evolutions inside the pulse region result in the strong light phase-modulation along with the amplitude-modulation and whereby violation of the adiabatic description. The development of these phenomena is by production of the effective radiation back-reactions.","The statement about approximate equality of phase and group velocities is incorrect.

In this paper, we present a new framework to design the CM-based RDH method. Firstly, to suppress the file size expansion and improve the applicability, a new code mapping strategy is proposed. Based on the proposed strategy, the mapped codes are redefined by customizing a new Huffman table thoroughly rather than selected from the unused codes in the original Huffman table. Afterwards, the key issue of designing the CM-based RDH method, i.e., constructing the code mapping, is converted into solving a combinatorial optimization problem. As a realization, a novel CM-based RDH method is introduced by employing the genetic algorithm (GA).

Furthermore, CNN-based local convolutions lack the ability to model the extensive inter-category dependencies. Therefore, this paper introduces a graph reasoning-based approach to enhance WSSS. The aim is to improve WSSS holistically by simultaneously enhancing both the multi-label classification and segmentation network stages. In the multi-label classification network segment, external knowledge is integrated, coupled with GCNs, to globally reason about inter-class dependencies. This encourages the network to uncover features in non-salient regions of images, thereby refining the completeness of generated pseudo-labels. In the segmentation network segment, the proposed Graph Reasoning Mapping (GRM) module is employed to leverage knowledge obtained from textual databases, facilitating contextual reasoning for class representation within image regions. This GRM module enhances feature representation in high-level semantics of the segmentation network's local convolutions, while dynamically learning semantic coherence for individual samples. Using solely image-level supervision, we have achieved state-of-the-art performance in WSSS on the PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS-COCO datasets. Extensive experimentation on both the multi-label classification and segmentation network stages underscores the effectiveness of the proposed graph reasoning approach for advancing WSSS.","Our description in Chapter 3, Section 3.2 of the paper is too repetitive with the paper ""Object detection meets knowledge graphs"".

The integrality gap of this relaxation is at least $36/31$, and it has long been conjectured that its true value is very close to this lower bound. However, the best upper bound for general graphs is still $2$. With the aim of circumventing the asymmetric nature of BCR, Chakrabarty, Devanur and Vazirani [Math. Program., 130 (2011), pp. 1--32] introduced the simplex-embedding LP, which is equivalent to it. Using this, they gave a $\sqrt{2}$-approximation algorithm for quasi-bipartite graphs and showed that the integrality gap of the relaxation is at most $4/3$ for this class of graphs. In this paper, we extend the approach provided by these authors and show that the integrality gap of BCR is at most $7/6$ on quasi-bipartite graphs via a fast combinatorial algorithm. In doing so, we introduce a general technique, in particular a potentially widely applicable extension of the primal-dual schema. Roughly speaking, we apply the schema twice with variable rates of growth for the duals in the second phase, where the rates depend on the degrees of the duals computed in the first phase. This technique breaks the disadvantage of increasing dual variables in a monotone manner and creates a larger total dual value, thus presumably attaining the true integrality gap.","Algorithm does not terminate.

For ALPS II, this is a risk reduction activity. However, the regeneration cavity in ALPS is fundamentally very similar to signal recycling in interferometric gravitational wave detectors (LIGO, VIRGO, GEO, and KAGRA) and the basic idea might very well be applicable there as well.",The conclusion of the paper is likely wrong.

It is expected that this estimate can be applied to error estimates for finite element approximation of the non-stationary Navier--Stokes equations, since studies in this direction are successful in numerical analysis of nonlinear parabolic equations. To derive the resolvent estimate, we introduce the solution of the Stokes resolvent problem with a discrete external force. We then obtain local energy error estimate according to a novel localization technique and establish global $L^p$-type error estimates. The restriction for $p$ is caused by the treatment of lower-order terms appearing in the local energy error estimate.

But nevertheless if not perfect, people have tried to delete it approximately. In these approximate deleting processes our basic target is to delete one of the two identical copies as much as possible while preserving the other copy. In this brief report, by using the No communication theorem (NCT) (impossibility of sending signal faster than light using a quantum resource) as a guiding principle, we obtain a bound on the sum of the fidelity of deletion and the fidelity of preservation.

This control method is observed to be able to significantly reduce the friction drag and even laminarize the flow under certain control parameters, which are dictated by velocity amplitude and wavelength, for friction Reynolds number Re{\tau} =180. Net energy saving is achievable and the variation of wavelength is found to be more efficient than velocity amplitude in reducing the drag. A series of turbulence statistics are discussed in order to elucidate the impact of steady spatially oscillatory forcing, including budgets of transport equation, turbulence intensity, two-point correlation and one-dimensional spectra. An overall assessment of global energy balance identifies a trend toward laminar regime. The control-induced boundary layer, whose thickness is closely related to control wavelength, is shown to induce a streamwise wavy streak pattern, with its orientation governed by the shear force stemming from gradients of mean velocity. Such strong spatial non-homogeneity is found to significantly reduce the streamwise scale of flow structure. The analysis of conditional-averaged fields reveals an emergence of strong transverse advection, which is observed to cause asymmetrical modification of near-wall quasi-streamwise vortex pair, accompanied by the transverse tilt or diffusion of low-speed streaks and the suppression of its surrounding sweep events, leading to the disruption of near-wall quasi-organized flow structure and hence in turn contributing to the decline of turbulent shear stress.",We have found some data mistakes in our paper.

1912.10027v2,1912.10027v1,Numerical Analysis (math.NA),IMEX error inhibiting schemes with post-processing,"High order implicit-explicit (IMEX) methods are often desired when evolving the solution of an ordinary differential equation that has a stiff part that is linear and a non-stiff part that is nonlinear. This situation often arises in semi-discretization of partial differential equations and many such IMEX schemes have been considered in the literature. The methods considered usually have a a global error that is of the same order as the local truncation error. More recently, methods with global errors that are one order higher than predicted by the local truncation error have been devised (by Kulikov and Weiner, Ditkowski and Gottlieb). In prior work we investigated the interplay between the local truncation error and the global error to construct explicit and implicit {\em error inhibiting schemes} that control the accumulation of the local truncation error over time, resulting in a global error that is one order higher than expected from the local truncation error, and which can be post-processed to obtain a solution which is two orders higher than expected. In this work we extend our error inhibiting with post-processing framework introduced in our previous work to a class of additive general linear methods with multiple steps and stages. We provide sufficient conditions under which these methods with local truncation error of order p will produce solutions of order (p+1), which can be post-processed to order (p+2), and describe the construction of one such post-processor. We apply this approach to obtain implicit-explicit (IMEX) methods with multiple steps and stages.

Rev. A {\bf 64}, 012310 (2001)]. Starting with a squeezed-vacuum state with an arbitrary polarization, we show that a linear-optical setup that implements quantum walks of the state in phase space is capable of generating an output state that corresponds to a variant of the GKP codeword states. In particular, with a coin toss that projects the mode polarization onto the diagonal direction, we show that the resulting {\em dissipative} quantum walks can generate qubit encoding akin to the prototypical GKP encoding. We analyze the performance of our codewords for error corrections and find that even without optimization our codewords outperform the GKP ones by a narrow margin. This demonstrates the potential of the proposed encoding scheme.","We find the polarization degrees of freedom of the squeezed light had not been treated properly in our analysis, which would affect our results significantly especially in the case of dissipative quantum walks.

In the typical HEM scenario, a planet forms beyond the ice line, but alternatively a planet can disk migrate or form warm and undergo a short final stretch of HEM. At the warm origin point, general relavistic precession can reduce the amplitude of Kozai-Lidov oscillations driven by an outer companion. We show that warm planets that achieve HEM under these conditions -- and with common types of planetary and stellar companions -- tend to end up with near-polar spin-orbit alignments (psi = 50-130 degrees) instead of concentrated at 40 and 140 degrees. Thus short distance, GR-reduced HEM is a possible explanation for the observed population of perpendicular planets.","Several sections, particularly Section 5, contain an error interpreting the mutual inclination directly as the obliquity",9,TRUE

We thus create synthetic molecular-line observations of simulated collapsing, spherically-symmetric, density fluctuations of low initial amplitude, embedded in a uniform, globally gravitationally unstable background, without a turbulent component. The collapsing core develops a flattened, Bonnor-Ebert-like density profile, but with an outside-in radial velocity profile, where the peak infall speeds are at large radii, in lower density gas, with cloud-to-core accretion, and no hydrostatic outer envelope. Using optically thick HCO$^+$ J=1-0 and 3-2 rotational lines, we consider several ""typical"" beamwidths and use a simple line-fitting model to infer infall speeds from the synthetic profiles similarly to what is done in standard line modeling. We find that the inferred infall speeds are ~ 25-30% of the actual peak infall speed as the largest speeds are downweighted by the low density gas in which they occur, due to the outside-in nature of the actual radial collapse profile. Also, with the N$_2$H$^+$ $J_{F_1F}=1_{01}-0_{12}$ hyperfine line, we investigate the change in the asymmetry parameter, $\delta v\equiv(V_{thick}-V_{thin})/\Delta v_{thin}$, during the collapse, finding good agreement with observed values. Finally, the HCO$^+$ J=3-2 lines exhibit extreme $T_b$/$T_r$-ratios like those for evolved cores, for larger beams late in the collapse. Our results suggest that standard dynamical infall reproduces several observed features, but that low-mass core infall speeds are generally undervalued, often interpreted as being subsonic although the actual speeds are supersonic, due to incorrectly assuming an inside-out infall radial velocity profile with a static outer envelope.",The velocities in the radiative transfer analysis for each snapshot of the simulated collapsing core are a factor of 1.732 (the square root of 3) smaller along each of the three dimensions.

1306.2988v2,1306.2988v1,Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS),Matching with our Eyes Closed,"Motivated by an application in kidney exchange, we study the following query-commit problem: we are given the set of vertices of a non-bipartite graph G. The set of edges in this graph are not known ahead of time. We can query any pair of vertices to determine if they are adjacent. If the queried edge exists, we are committed to match the two endpoints. Our objective is to maximize the size of the matching. This restriction in the amount of information available to the algorithm constraints us to implement myopic, greedy-like algorithms. A simple deterministic greedy algorithm achieves a factor 1/2 which is tight for deterministic algorithms. An important open question in this direction is to give a randomized greedy algorithm that has a significantly better approximation factor. This question was first asked almost 20 years ago by Dyer and Frieze [9] where they showed that a natural randomized strategy of picking edges uniformly at random doesn't help and has an approximation factor of 1/2 + o(1). They left it as an open question to devise a better randomized greedy algorithm. In subsequent work, Aronson, Dyer, Frieze, and Suen [2] gave a different randomized greedy algorithm and showed that it attains a factor 0.5 + epsilon where epsilon is 0.0000025. In this paper we propose and analyze a new randomized greedy algorithm for finding a large matching in a general graph and use it to solve the query commit problem mentioned above. We show that our algorithm attains a factor of at least 0.56, a significant improvement over 0.50000025. We also show that no randomized algorithm can have an approximation factor better than 0.7916 for the query commit problem.

When different bidders have different demands and valuations on different types of resources or tasks, the auction becomes a combinatorial auction (CA), for which finding an optimal auction result that maximizes total winning bid is NP-hard.

It also includes a critical-value-based pricing scheme for each winner to locally compute her payment. We analyze stabilization, correctness, and consistency properties of the proposed approach.

In particular the holonomy $b$-groupoid allows us to consider the appropriate pseudodifferential calculus and the appropriate index problems. We further use the blup groupoids as the one above, and in particular its functoriality properties, to actually get index theorems. In this situtation there are two index morphisms, one related to ellipticity and a second one related to fully ellipticity. For the first one, we are able to extend to this setting the longitudinal Connes-Skandalis index theorem and to use it to get that a $b$-longitudinal elliptic operator can be perturbed (up stable homotopy within elliptic operators) with a regularizing operator in the calculus to get a fully elliptic operator if and only if a certain boundary topological index vanishes. For example in the case of a fibration (family case) this topological obstruction is always zero. For the second index morphism, the one related to fully elliptic operators (families of Fredholm operators), we restrict ourselves to the case of families of manifolds with boundary and we prove a new K-theoretical index theorem, i.e. construct a topological index and prove the equality with the analytic-Fredholm index, and use it to get a cohomological index formula for every fully elliptic operator.

Particularly, motivated by the desire to avoid infinities, a complex scalar finite field that aims to describe the Higgs field is proposed as the underlying field of an extremely huge finite group of Lie type. Then, the occurrence of a critical point of the phase transition in that finite field is explained, and the mass of its bosons is computed employing the Klein-Gordon equation. Next, in a backward analysis, to curiously estimate magnificence of that finite group of Lie type, the mass of Higgs boson is inputted to the obtained mass relation, and a huge order close to the order of the Monster group is outputted. Supported by such a clue as well as the fact that the Monster group is critical among the sporadic groups, it is therefore assumed that the critical order of the corresponding symmetry group (of Lie type), at which its underlying finite field reaches the critical point of a phase transition, is the order of the Monster group. Based on this assumption, the main observation is reported as M_H/M_P = D m_(q^*)/m_2, where M_H, M_P, m_(q^*), m_2, and D, are respectively, the mass of Higgs boson, the reduced Planck mass, the mass of bosons of the finite field, the mass of field with two elements, and the number of spatial dimensions which perfectly match the central charge (i.e., number of degrees of freedom) in the Monster conformal field theory.","The article has been withdrawn due to incorrect model formulation.

We show that by using new multiorbital effects of the $t_{2g}$ orbitals on coefficients of those interactions, we can change the effective dimensionality from three-dimensional to two-dimensional, and control the competition between chiral orders and spin liquid. We also show that the new multiorbital effects are vital to stabilize three-in-one-out chiral order, distorted four-in-four-out chiral order, and distorted three-in-one-out chiral order, and can be used to hold macroscopic degeneracy, resulting in the spin liquid, even with the finite Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interactions.

The other $n-1$ near-coherence classes are represented by Ramsey ultrafilters with character $\aleph_2$ that are not $P_{\aleph_2}$-points. For constructing such a forcing extension we combine Ramsey theory on the space of block sequences with Ramsey theory in Ellentuck spaces. We develop forcing techniques for destroying and resurrecting selective ultrafilters.

We develop a combinatorial framework for establishing that exponential decay with distance of spin correlations, specifically the strong spatial mixing condition (SSM), implies rapid mixing of a large class of Markov chains. As a first application of our method we prove that SSM implies $O(\log n)$ mixing of systematic scan dynamics (under mild conditions) on an $n$-vertex $d$-dimensional cube of the integer lattice graph $\mathbb{Z}^d$. Systematic scan dynamics are widely employed in practice but have proved hard to analyze. A second application of our technology concerns the Swendsen-Wang dynamics for the ferromagnetic Ising and Potts models. We show that SSM implies an $O(1)$ bound for the relaxation time (i.e., the inverse spectral gap). As a by-product of this implication we observe that the relaxation time of the Swendsen-Wang dynamics in square boxes of $\mathbb{Z}^2$ is $O(1)$ throughout the subcritical regime of the $q$-state Potts model, for all $q \ge 2$. We also use our combinatorial framework to give a simple coupling proof of the classical result that SSM entails optimal mixing time of the Glauber dynamics.

The alignment is a consequence of the fact that the length of a repelling (respectively, attracting) LCS shrinks rapidly under advection in forward (respectively, backward) time. As a result, the points along a hyperbolic LCS sample similar values of the scalar field, leading to almost uniform distribution of the path-averaged scalar along the LCS. Our results illuminate the relation between the variational theory of hyperbolic LCSs and a significant subset of mixing diagnostics which are obtained as path-averaged scalars.

However, their use of fully connected layers as well as pre-trained VGG forces a compromise between reconstruction accuracy and processing speed. In addition, this approach is limited to the use of a specific spatial resolution. To remedy these problems, we propose exploiting fully convolutional networks (FCN) for SIVG.

That framework is an extension to infinity-categories of the tangent categories of Cockett and Cruttwell (introduced originally by Rosick_). The basic data of a tangent infinity-category consist of an endofunctor, that plays the role of the tangent bundle construction, together with various natural transformations that mimic structure possessed by the ordinary tangent bundles of smooth manifolds. The role of the tangent bundle functor in Goodwillie calculus is played by Lurie's tangent bundle for infinity-categories, introduced to generalize the cotangent complexes of Andr_, Quillen and Illusie. We show that Lurie's construction admits the additional structure maps and satisfies the conditions needed to form a tangent infinity-category which we refer to as the Goodwillie tangent structure. Cockett and Cruttwell (and others) have started to develop various aspects of differential geometry in the abstract context of tangent categories, and we begin to apply those ideas to Goodwillie calculus. For example, we show that the role of Euclidean spaces in the calculus of manifolds is played in Goodwillie calculus by the stable infinity-categories.

Given decades of no conclusive evidence to support any dark matter candidate so far, there is strong motivation to consider alternatives to the standard particle scenario. One such example is macro dark matter, a class of candidates that could interact quite strongly with the particles of the Standard Model, have large masses and physical sizes, yet behave as dark matter.

We show that the associated initial value problem is locally and globally well-posed in Sobolev spaces $H^s(\mathbb{R})$, where $s>1/2$. We also show that our result is sharp, in the sense that the flow-map data-solution is not $C^2$ at origin, for $s<1/2$. Furthermore, we prove that the associated value problem for your derivative equation is locally and globally well-posed in $H^s(\mathbb{R})$, for $s>-1/2$, and that the flow-map data-solution is not $C^2$ at origin, for $s<-1/2$. Finally, we study the behavior of solutions when $\mu\downarrow 0$. In particular, the method used, allows us to obtain the solution of the Burgers' equation.",We can not use fixed-point theorem in the spaces defined in section 4.,22,TRUE

1809.01643v2,1809.01643v1,Econometrics (econ.EM),Efficient Difference-in-Differences Estimation with High-Dimensional Common Trend Confounding,"We contribute to the theoretical literature on difference-in-differences estimation for policy evaluation by allowing the common trend assumption to hold conditional on a high-dimensional covariate set. In particular, the covariates can enter the difference-in-differences model in a very flexible form leading to estimation procedures that involve supervised machine learning methods. We derive asymptotic results for semiparametric and parametric estimators for repeated cross-sections and panel data and show desirable statistical properties. Notably, a non-standard semiparametric efficiency bound for difference-in-differences estimation that incorporates the repeated cross-section case is established. Our proposed semiparametric estimator is shown to attain this bound. The usability of the methods is assessed by replicating a study on an employment protection reform. We demonstrate that the notion of high-dimensional common trend confounding has implications for the economic interpretation of policy evaluation results via difference-in-differences.",Error in proof for efficiency bound.

1203.2581v2,1203.2581v1,Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con),Possible Pairing Symmetry in Iron-Pnictide Superconductor KFe$_2$As$_2$,"We perform the first-principles band structure calculation on the iron-pnictide superconductor KFe$_2$As$_2$ and show that the Fe-$3d_{z^2}$ orbital character is quite strong around Z point. Based on this band structure, we propose an effective model, and examine all possible pairing symmetries for this compound. We find that the $k_z$-dependent s-wave pairing symmetry is most favored, if the interlayer pairing strength is comparable to the intralayer one. This pairing symmetry with nodes is originated from the large size of the hole pocket at the zone center and can be used to explain the neutron scattering experiments. However, the pairing symmetry appears to be $S_{x^2+y^2}$ like, if the magnetic exchange couplings obtained by first-principles calculation are used as pairing interactions.",This paper has been withdrawn by the author due to a crucial error in equation 2,5,TRUE
1912.11842v3,1912.11842v2,Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph),Background Field Method in Thermo Field Dynamics Theory for Wave Propagation in Unmagnetized Spinor QED Plasmas,"In this work, a many body relativistic quantum field theory for the collective modes of spinor quantum electrodynamic theory (QED) plasmas is developed. We introduce the thermo field dynamics into the QED plasma study. The nontrivial background field method is used to take account of the non-perturbativity of background charged plasma particles and radiation field. It is an extension of ""Furry picture"" which is first introduced by Yuan Shi, et al. [Phys. Rev. A 94, 012124 (2016)] in their scalar QED plasma study. However, their wave function method in evaluating the background field of ideal system is hard to extend to the general many body cases. We propose a classical limit method that most perturbative high energy and quantum many body aspects can be included in a practical way. As an example, the wave propagation in unmagnetized electron-positron plasma is discussed. In the low energy limit case, the well known wave dispersion relations for non-relativistic degenerate plasma are recovered. In addition, mass increase of plasma particles due to the relativity, effective charge decrease due to the vacuum polarization, finite light velocity influence on the dispersion relation, and temperature influence on plasma system are discussed. Besides, new phenomenons including the zero sound of the electron-positron pair plasma and the particle production induced by the plasma oscillation are first reported. At last, the high energy limit case is studied.","There is a serious mistake in the section 4 in this paper. The paper concludes that there is new particle production in the system due to the plasma oscillation. However, the fact that the imaginary part of the self-energy will always be zero in the nonrelativistic limit indicates no new particle created",19,TRUE
2212.07368v2,2212.07368v1,Signal Processing (eess.SP),Reconstruction of Multivariate Sparse Signals from Mismatched Samples,"Erroneous correspondences between samples and their respective channel or target commonly arise in several real-world applications. For instance, whole-brain calcium imaging of freely moving organisms, multiple target tracking or multi-person contactless vital sign monitoring may be severely affected by mismatched sample-channel assignments. To systematically address this fundamental problem, we pose it as a signal reconstruction problem where we have lost correspondences between the samples and their respective channels. We show that under the assumption that the signals of interest admit a sparse representation over an overcomplete dictionary, unique signal recovery is possible. Our derivations reveal that the problem is equivalent to a structured unlabeled sensing problem without precise knowledge of the sensing matrix. Unfortunately, existing methods are neither robust to errors in the regressors nor do they exploit the structure of the problem. Therefore, we propose a novel robust two-step approach for the reconstruction of shuffled sparse signals. The performance and robustness of the proposed approach is illustrated in an application of whole-brain calcium imaging in computational neuroscience. The proposed framework can be generalized to sparse signal representations other than the ones considered in this work to be applied in a variety of real-world problems with imprecise measurement or channel assignment.","There is an error in the use of Corollary 1 in our Paper, which does not apply in our case",13,TRUE

For this purpose, we derive upper bounds for the eavesdropping collective attacks on general CV-QKD protocols. The derived bounds are tight for all CV-QKD protocols that involve two-mode entangled state. We also show that the eavesdropper's accessible information is independent of the correlation between Alice and Bob modes in reverse reconciliation scheme, while in direct reconciliation scheme, Eve information is given as a function of Alice-Bob correlation.","This paper has been withdrawn by the author due to a crucial error in equation 42, 50, 51",23,FALSE

We first derive an integro-differential equation that the solutions must satisfy. Then we show that choreographic solutions in the limit correspond to travelling waves of this equation, which turns out to be the Euler-Lagrange equation of a corresponding limiting functional. We can then prove the existence of solutions for this type of problem, which we call continuous choreographies, using a variational approach. In particular, we show that the circle is a {\em continuous choreography} on the plane for $0<\sigma<1$, but the circle is not the minimun of the functional of action.",This paper has been withdrawn by the author due to a crucial error in equation (39),18,TRUE

It was formulated independently by Szekeres (1973) and Seymour (1979). In this paper, we settle the conjecture in the affirmative.

The definition is based on closed-open sector linear space isomorphisms and boundary condition completeness. Diagonal RCFTs can be applied to our definition straight-forwardly, while more classes of CFT$_2$ are expected to be applicable. An unconventional open sector sewing, not among open sector sewing introduced by Lewellen, rises naturally and generalizes the definition. Our geometrical approach, partially inspired by string field theory, reveals the relationship between algebraic information in CFT$_2$ and curvature on surfaces.","Errors in the method to determine the S-transformation coefficients, because the characters for the surfaces are not simply the product of characters for cylinders.

Roughly speaking, the problem is that the indices ""i_s"" and ""r"" are competing with each other and therefore what I believed to be immediate, as happens naturally in the case of a single index, and as can be seen in the proof of Theorem 6.7 of the FHHMZ reference, is in fact not immediate in the situation where double indices are involved",17,TRUE
1911.03748v2,1911.03748v1,Computational Complexity (cs.CC),Quantum speedups need structure,"We prove the following conjecture, raised by Aaronson and Ambainis in 2008: Let $f:\{-1,1\}^n \rightarrow [-1,1]$ be a multilinear polynomial of degree $d$. Then there exists a variable $x_i$ whose influence on $f$ is at least $\mathrm{poly}(\mathrm{Var}(f)/d)$. As was shown by Aaronson and Ambainis, this result implies the following well-known conjecture on the power of quantum computing, dating back to 1999: Let $Q$ be a quantum algorithm that makes $T$ queries to a Boolean input and let $\epsilon,\delta > 0$. Then there exists a deterministic classical algorithm that makes $\mathrm{poly}(T,1/\epsilon,1/\delta)$ queries to the input and that approximates $Q$'s acceptance probability to within an additive error $\epsilon$ on a $1-\delta$ fraction of inputs. In other words, any quantum algorithm can be simulated on most inputs by a classical algorithm which is only polynomially slower, in terms of query complexity.","Unfortunately, our proof contains a serious flaw.
